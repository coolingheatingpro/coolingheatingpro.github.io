I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

They might spread out throughout the whole office or structure by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
