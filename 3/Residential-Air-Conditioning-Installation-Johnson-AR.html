<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part.
