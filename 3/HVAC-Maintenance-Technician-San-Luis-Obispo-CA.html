<p>Blue HVAC disposable fiberglass air conditioning filters are the most common. It does the least filtering out of all of the cooling filters. If you are using the blue air conditioning filter, it is simply a matter of time before your evaporator coil needs to get cleared out.

It only takes three or four unclean cooling filter modifications to start congesting your evaporator coil.

<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>When your home's furnace stops working, your home can have more issues than simply being uneasy. Every minute that your heater is off also positions your pipelines at the danger of freezing.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
