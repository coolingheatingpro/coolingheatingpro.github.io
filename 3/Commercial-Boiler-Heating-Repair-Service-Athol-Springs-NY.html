<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems at Athol Springs NY</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends upon specific sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to individual.
