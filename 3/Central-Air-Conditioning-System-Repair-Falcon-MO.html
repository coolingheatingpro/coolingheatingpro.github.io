<p>Streamline your services, make more services revenue, and provide a remarkable customer experience. To ensure the system you choose is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load estimation estimate to identify the precise kind of heat and a/c system that's perfect for your home-we do not simply replace it with the same size unit you currently have. These estimations take into account things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is important so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to replace or update your system if it's five years of ages or older. The best central air conditioner you can purchase today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while providing the very same amount of cooling.<p>
