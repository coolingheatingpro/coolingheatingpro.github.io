This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
