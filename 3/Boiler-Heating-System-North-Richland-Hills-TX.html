<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
