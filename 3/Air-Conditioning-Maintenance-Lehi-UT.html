Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great possibility; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on unusual occasions.<p>
