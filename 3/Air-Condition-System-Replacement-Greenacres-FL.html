<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
