<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, many Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC system is not working. The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your issue.
