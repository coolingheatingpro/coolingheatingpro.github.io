<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent gos to, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
