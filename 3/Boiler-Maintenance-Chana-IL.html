<h3>The Way to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Chana IL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
