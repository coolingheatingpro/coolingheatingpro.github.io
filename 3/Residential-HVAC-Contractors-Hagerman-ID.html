<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
