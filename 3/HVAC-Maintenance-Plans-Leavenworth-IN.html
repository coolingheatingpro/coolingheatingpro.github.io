<p>We needed 2 check outs - Jake came out initially and was enjoyable and extremely educated and polite. Grant came out a couple days later on and was also educated and nice to talk to. They both did a terrific job. Sabre's workplace staff is extremely useful, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and supplying the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Definitely recommend.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand. Likewise, keep fire safety in mind when deciding where to install the a/c: Don't put it in an egress window that acts as the only methods of escape must a fire erupt.<p>
<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and solidify-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
