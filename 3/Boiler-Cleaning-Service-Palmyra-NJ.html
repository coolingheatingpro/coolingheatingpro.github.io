Service technicians are frequently required to work in confined areas, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofs of houses.

The cost of your air conditioner will vary depending on the size of your house, model you pick, unique installation requirements - even where you live and the climate in your area.

<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>The repayment for a system can vary from 2-10 years, while the life time of a system can be 18-23 years, almost double a traditional system.

Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
