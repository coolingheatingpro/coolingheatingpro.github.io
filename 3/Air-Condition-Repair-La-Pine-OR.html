<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Through typical usage and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner may end up being very unclean.

This is an exceptional opportunity to recognize parts that are used or malfunctioning. When the problem is fairly minor, changing them to fix the air conditioning may be a lot less expensive.<p>
