<p>When our furnace was dying, we called two local companies for bids. While both were handy and informative, Ballard Gas provided us a much better offer, for exceptional service. Rather than an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating system and located ways we might have more even heat. He included these small however substantial adjustments in his quote. Because of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons, we decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>Gas heaters do come with some disadvantages. The biggest disadvantage is also the result of the combustion process. This procedure releases exhaust gases, consisting of carbon monoxide, which need to be vented to the beyond the home.
