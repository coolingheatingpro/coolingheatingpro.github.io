<p>Great Product! Shipment was kind of odd being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and requires time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we resolved problems. I would suggest this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
