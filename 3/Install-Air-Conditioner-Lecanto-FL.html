<p>Great Product! Shipment was kind of odd being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and requires time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit.
