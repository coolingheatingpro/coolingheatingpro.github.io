<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
