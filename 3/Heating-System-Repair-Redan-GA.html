<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may become stopped up, minimizing air flow volume, distribution, and quality. They likewise might become locations for molds and bacteria to grow and be distributed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise should be correctly kept to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
