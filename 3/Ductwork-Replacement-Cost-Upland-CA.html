<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power ought to not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit.

Put simply, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not simple, because it takes into consideration not only the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
