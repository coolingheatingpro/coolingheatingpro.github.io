To make sure the unit you pick is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation quote to figure out the exact kind of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we don't simply replace it with the same size unit you presently have. These estimations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is essential so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>
