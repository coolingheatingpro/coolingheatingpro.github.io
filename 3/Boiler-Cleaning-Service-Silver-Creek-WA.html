<p>Central air units are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in gathering information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
