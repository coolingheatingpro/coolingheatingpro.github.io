<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price great however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced.
