<p>In addition to offering repair services, our knowledgeable Seattle furnace specialists are prepared to frequently service your furnace to keep it running efficiently. When they are small and reduces the need for pricey repairs in the future, preventative maintenance and annual furnace tune-ups help identify concerns. Regular maintenance can also lead to enhanced effectiveness and potentially extend your system's life in the long run.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the abilities or tools required to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician examine the system periodically.<p>

Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this section.<p>
