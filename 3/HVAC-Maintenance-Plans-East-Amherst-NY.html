<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
