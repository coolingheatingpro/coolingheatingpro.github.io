<p>A third method to decide whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can indicate your home might not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on windows or walls, stinky or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To find odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
