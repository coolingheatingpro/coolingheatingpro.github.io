<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
