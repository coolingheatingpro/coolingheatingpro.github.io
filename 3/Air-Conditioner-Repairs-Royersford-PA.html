<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the quantity of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must also be taken to reduce contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, residents should look out to the emergence of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization measures must not be undertaken until these issues have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>The toxins noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health effects pointed out. However, it is not always true that the effects kept in mind take place at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the home. In many cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health effects is too minimal to identify the levels at which the listed impacts could happen.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered remarkable, tailored, attentive, and quality service. His interaction design is friendly, effective and appealing.

He followed through and went the extra mile to personally pick up a needed part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my better half and I would not have to endure another night without heat, during among the coldest winter seasons in recent memory. He also reacted to my call instantly the next early morning, and coached me through a short-lived fix to an issue that couldn't be dealt with on the very first visit due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and capability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
