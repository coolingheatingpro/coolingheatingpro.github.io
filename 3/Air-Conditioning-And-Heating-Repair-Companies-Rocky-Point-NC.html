<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
