<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be brought on as the outcome of temperature extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow. Office temperature levels must be kept between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by too much air blood circulation must be avoided.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to effectively cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
