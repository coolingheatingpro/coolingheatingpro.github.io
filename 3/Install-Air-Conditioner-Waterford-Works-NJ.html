But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.
