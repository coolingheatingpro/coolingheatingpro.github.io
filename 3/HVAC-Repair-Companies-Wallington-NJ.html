<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
