<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly might be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue.
