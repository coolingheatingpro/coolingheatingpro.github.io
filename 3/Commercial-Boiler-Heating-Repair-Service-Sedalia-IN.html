<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician examine the system regularly.<p>
