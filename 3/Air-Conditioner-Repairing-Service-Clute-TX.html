<p>While contaminants commonly found in indoor air are responsible for many damaging effects, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are essential to produce particular health issue. People also respond really differently to direct exposure to indoor air toxins. Additional research study is needed to better understand which health impacts occur after exposure to the average pollutant concentrations discovered in houses and which occur from the greater concentrations that happen for short amount of times.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently essential to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If monitoring information is not available, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent must ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data may determine possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
