<p>We're investing a lot more time inside, these days. While many individuals presume pollution is just an outdoor issue, your home (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we make certain that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we don't think sufficient about exposure to all the things we put in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- right away, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe much easier.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a vehicle radiator or typical family air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>
