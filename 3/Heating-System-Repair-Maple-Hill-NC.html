If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists if no contaminant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.

When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of employees in the area, stagnant air might also be an issue.<p>

Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be deadly). Signs of these illness do disappoint up until several years after direct exposure started.
