<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
