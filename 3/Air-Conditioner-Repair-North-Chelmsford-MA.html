<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
