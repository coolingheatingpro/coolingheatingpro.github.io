<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy effective approaches of heating or cooling a home. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated up in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels discovered just a few feet below ground. In the summer months, the process reverses, thereby cooling a house by eliminating heat.

<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally higher than many heat pump choices, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the design you acquire. Among the primary advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating choices. This means it can heat up your house to the wanted temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
