<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Heaters as they age run the risk of developing cracks in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide, if present, might leakage into your house undetected.

<p>There is a necessary balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE rankings frequently come with higher price tags.

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan need to spin.

If  it doesn't, you've given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
