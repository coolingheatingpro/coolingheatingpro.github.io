<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one environmental danger to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gas, water pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but lots of utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a much better service. If the existing system has actually not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and concerns that caused the breakdown can be determined and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense also.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
