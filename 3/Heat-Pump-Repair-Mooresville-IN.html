All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unblocked and dry.<p>

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
