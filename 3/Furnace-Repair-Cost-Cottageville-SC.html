Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.

<p>Current Evaluation: They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my requirements completely by supplying a professional quote with options, without pressing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the necessary examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and perhaps refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimum effectiveness and could overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also cause your energy costs to rise. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not huge enough for your home. It will have to work more difficult and might get too hot if the system is too small. Generally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
