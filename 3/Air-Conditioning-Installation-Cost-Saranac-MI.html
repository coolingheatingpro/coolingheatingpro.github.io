<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
