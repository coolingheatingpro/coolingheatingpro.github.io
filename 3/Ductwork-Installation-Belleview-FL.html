I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is truthful, trusted, and affordable on price. It's tough to find a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>
