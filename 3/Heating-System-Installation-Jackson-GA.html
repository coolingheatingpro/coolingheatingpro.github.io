<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace specialists typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
