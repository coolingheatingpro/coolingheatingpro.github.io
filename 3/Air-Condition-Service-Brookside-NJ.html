<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those processes include generating outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air outside. If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
