<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
