<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Hanna Indiana</h3>
<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer.

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
