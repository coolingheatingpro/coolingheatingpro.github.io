All the moist hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC unit is not draining correctly, you'll have a water leakage. A constraint in your drain pipes triggers a water leak. There are several locations a clog can happen. Among the primary locations where obstructions begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

<h3>HVAC Filters in Hammond LA</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is sincere, dependable, and sensible on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
