<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 need to not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC use the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the type of electrical power. The two operations utilize various procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>
