<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
