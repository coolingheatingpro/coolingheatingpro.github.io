<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S).

Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
