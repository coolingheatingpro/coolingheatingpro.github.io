<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
