<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards normally total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary rate of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new building (homes typically use in between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. Nevertheless, new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the best conditions.<p>
