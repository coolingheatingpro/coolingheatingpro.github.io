<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, a professional service person should be called for almost any maintenance aside from routine cleaning. Central air conditioners need to be expertly examined and changed prior to the beginning of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this annual examination. While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak performance.<p>
