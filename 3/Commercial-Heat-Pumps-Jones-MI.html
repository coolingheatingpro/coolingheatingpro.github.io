<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They met my requirements entirely by providing a professional quote with options, without pressing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the required inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
