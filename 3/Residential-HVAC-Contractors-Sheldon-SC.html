<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Sheldon SC</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Considering that worker wages and other HR costs will likely be the greatest expense for any HVAC organisation that hires staff, we're breaking this item out of the general discussion of financial forecasts and into its own category.

<p>Chemical contaminants: Unstable natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., office devices; furniture, floor and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 need to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
