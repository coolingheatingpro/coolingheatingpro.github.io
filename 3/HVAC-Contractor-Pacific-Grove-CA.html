<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very practical in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.

<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and solidify-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
