<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
