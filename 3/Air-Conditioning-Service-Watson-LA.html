<p>Power Vac America supplies commercial, industrial, institutional, marine and residential air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning company. The essential part of your a/c is the outdoor system. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its positioning on your property and its maintenance, it might sustain some damage throughout the winter. The majority of the time, this just includes some accumulation of dirt and debris, which is pretty easy to get rid of. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the exterior of the system and guarantee that there is no rust, damage from built up moisture, or excessive wear to the outside. They may recommend that you trim back overgrown trees or bushes to ensure adequate air flow around the system.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Watson Louisiana</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of dealing with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for nearly ten years and throughout that time, they have actually always offered excellent service. Every person I have actually handled is expert and friendly. The techs are prompt, effective and polite. They aim to finish every job as rapidly as possible and understand our financial requirements on all 5 of the commercial residential or commercial properties on which I assist with the management.<p>
