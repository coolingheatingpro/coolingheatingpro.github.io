<p>The purpose of many building ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building safety at sensible energy costs. Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or system cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone. Just like measuring the size of a system needed based on BTUs, figuring out the right size of unit for your house also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
