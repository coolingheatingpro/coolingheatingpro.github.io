Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
