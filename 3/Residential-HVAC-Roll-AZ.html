<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
