<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
