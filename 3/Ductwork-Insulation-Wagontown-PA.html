It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance gos to per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and normally some other advantages.
