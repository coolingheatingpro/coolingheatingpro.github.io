<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The purpose of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at sensible energy expenses. Load determining is referred to as the Manual J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or unit cost for a/c. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you require based upon experience or on square video alone, move to another contractor.
