<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one aspect (out of numerous) of a comfy environment.<p>
