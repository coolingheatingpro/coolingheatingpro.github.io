<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
