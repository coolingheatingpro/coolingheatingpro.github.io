<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
