<p>Indoor temperatures are often more tough to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>No matter the kind of electric glowing floor heating unit, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or changed. Any disturbance or disruption in the circulation of electricity makes the system unusable. This is one of the downsides to setting up an electric radiant heat system. However, presuming they are set up properly and effectively looked after, the probability of them having problems is little.<p>
