<h3>Appropriate Things To Look Out For In Your Rogers AR Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PREPARES: Your HVAC system is a financial investment that pays for itself over the years, but only if you protect it to the best of your capability. Luckily, this does not have to be a task! When you sign up for a Keefe's maintenance plan, we look after whatever. No matter what make or design of cooling or heating system you own, even if it's a zone control system, you'll get semi-annual inspections, marked down diagnostics, priority service, and incredible deals on repairs and replacements. Pick between our bronze, platinum, gold, and silver plans, and we'll provide you with the highest level of protection and maintenance.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
