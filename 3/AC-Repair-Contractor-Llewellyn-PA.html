<p>These people have been excellent. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to provide me an opinion for what work on a home might cost. Recently I required to contact these guys two times. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my client probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Most HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that permit property owners to manage the temperature level and set it on a schedule. For instance, you can set the thermostat to lower the heat when you're not in house to conserve money on the energy expenses and make sure the system isn't overburdened. An expert technician will examine the thermostat during the yearly maintenance to ensure the real temperature level and the temperature on the thermostat matches. If there's a difference in the temperature, the technician needs to check the thermostat's efficiency or assess the whole HVAC system.<p>
