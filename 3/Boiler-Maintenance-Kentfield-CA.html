<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
