<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, because it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
