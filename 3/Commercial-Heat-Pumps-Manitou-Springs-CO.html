<p>Aspects that can contribute to the growth of biological contaminants are wet or moist structure products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Various fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are pets and home plants.<p>
<p>When all the tasks have been completed, the last task is to evaluate the system to ensure it cools effectively. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This final check may point out faults in the thermostat, which may be as basic as a need to replace batteries. A failure to switch on may simply include a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician goes over any concerns or problems and makes suggestions about upgrades where appropriate.<p>

<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
