<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit.

But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
