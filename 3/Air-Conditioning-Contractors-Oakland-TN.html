<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
