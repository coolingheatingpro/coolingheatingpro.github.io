<p>The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends on a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends upon individual sensitivity, which differs tremendously from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical toxins as well.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being airborne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat irritant could cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Consider prospective impacts of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, specifically guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit properly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
