<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
