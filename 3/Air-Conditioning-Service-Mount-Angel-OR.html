<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Mount Angel OR</h3>

<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to run since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
