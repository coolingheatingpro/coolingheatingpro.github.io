An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee.

<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work.
