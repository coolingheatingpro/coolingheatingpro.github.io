The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
