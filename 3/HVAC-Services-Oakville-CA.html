<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller wall-mounted units, ductless divides enable you to prevent the need for a complete duct system like a lot of other cooling systems require. You will also take pleasure in a far more versatile system in regards to installation and cost. And since each indoor system has its own thermostat, you can bid farewell to thermostat warfare when someone would choose it a little warmer in a different room.<p>
