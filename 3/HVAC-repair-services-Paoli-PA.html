Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install examination results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>

If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most affordable. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
