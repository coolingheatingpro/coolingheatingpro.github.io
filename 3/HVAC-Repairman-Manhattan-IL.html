<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Manhattan IL?</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
