<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Morriston FL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
