<p>. Before selecting the installation place of air conditioning unit, numerous main factors need to be thought about. To start with, the instructions of air flow from the indoor systems ought to not fall on the location of rest or work area. Second of all, there must not be any challenges on the way of the air flow that might prevent it from covering the space of the properties as much as possible. The outdoor unit needs to likewise be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be effectively discharged outdoors and the productivity of the entire system will drop dramatically.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
