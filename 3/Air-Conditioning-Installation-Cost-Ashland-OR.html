<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had actually spotted the problem area in looking over the expense. He resolved the concern in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I considered fair prior to he called back, understood what may have caused the issue and had a plan to guarantee that it would not take place again.
