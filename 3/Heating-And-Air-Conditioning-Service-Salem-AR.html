<h3>HVAC Repair Cost in Salem AR</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
