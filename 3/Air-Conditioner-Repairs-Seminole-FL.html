<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, because it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely.
