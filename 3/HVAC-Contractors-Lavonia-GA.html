<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Inspect these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years earlier and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
