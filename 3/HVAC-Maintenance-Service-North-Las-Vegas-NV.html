However, a number of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
