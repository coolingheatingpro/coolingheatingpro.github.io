<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air.

Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT a great idea. You will not save any money and will wind up triggering more problems for your heater.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
