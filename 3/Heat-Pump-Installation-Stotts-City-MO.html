<p>Structures are developed or planned to react actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

In other cases, such changes subtly or even dramatically modify buildings in ways that may be very important to their own integrity or their influence on structure occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and preserve.<p>
