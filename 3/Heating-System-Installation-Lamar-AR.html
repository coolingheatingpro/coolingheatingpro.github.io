<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the unit. Loose, faulty or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes inspecting the advised connections along with temperature level and pressure determines. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and secure.<p>

Set up unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
