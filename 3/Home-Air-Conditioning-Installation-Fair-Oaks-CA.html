<h3>Ways To Get the Most out of Your HVAC System at Fair Oaks CA</h3>

Their techs are expert and very well-informed. Costs are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser today. Since the cost was certainly sensible, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Commercial HVAC in Fair Oaks CA</h3>
<p>Central air units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
