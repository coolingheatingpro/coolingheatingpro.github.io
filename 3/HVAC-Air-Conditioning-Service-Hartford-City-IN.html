<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based on existing clinical and technical understanding of the concerns provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The standards do not need you to change your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services should still be offered for your home's systems.

Manufacturers usually continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard enters into impact.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
