<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
