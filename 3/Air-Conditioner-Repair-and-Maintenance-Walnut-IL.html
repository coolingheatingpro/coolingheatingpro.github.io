<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by many public water materials, it has been found in well water. If you have actually checked the air in your house and found a radon issue, and you have a well, get in touch with a lab accredited to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
