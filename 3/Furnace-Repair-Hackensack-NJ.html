<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, many Midtown Houston Tx clients do not know why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next action is to thaw your cooling equipment. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
