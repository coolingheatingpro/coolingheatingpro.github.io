<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature level. Heating systems that kick on frequently may be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
