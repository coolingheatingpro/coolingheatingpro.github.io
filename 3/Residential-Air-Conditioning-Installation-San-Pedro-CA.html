<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and offices matters, especially since we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the a/c is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the ac system will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>It may simply need to be cleaned up if your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running. Whether or not this is the cause of the issue, it's a great early treatment to attempt. Plan to do this on a fairly warm day. Never ever use a power washer for this-- it can harm the fins. The following are standards; always refer to your owner's handbook. Note: Constantly switch off the power before cleaning the unit.<p>
