<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Mojave CA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
