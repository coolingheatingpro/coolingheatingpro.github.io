<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
