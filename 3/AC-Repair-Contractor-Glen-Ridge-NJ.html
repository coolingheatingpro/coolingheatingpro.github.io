Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year.
