<p>Expert heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately fail. HVAC professionals recommend following this basic rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance sees per year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and typically some other perks. Some companies provide top priority consultations to their maintenance plan members.<p>
