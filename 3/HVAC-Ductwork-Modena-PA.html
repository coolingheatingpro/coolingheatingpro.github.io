<p>Ruud air conditioning unit are a budget friendly HVAC system that provides a full lineup of heating & cooling products. The Ruud Achiever RA16 which has a 16 SEER energy efficiency would cost anywhere between $3,500 to $3,695 to install. There's plenty of screening and consumer reviews that credit Ruud AC units as being lasting. They also have readily available parts throughout the U.S. so their replacements & service warranties are very time effective.

<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing product bought with your home. This company presented a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the evaluation on an extremely cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health hazard factor and contractor laws for their choice.
