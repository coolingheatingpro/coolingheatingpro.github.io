<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience periodic periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Shut off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work appropriately after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
