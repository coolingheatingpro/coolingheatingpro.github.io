<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
