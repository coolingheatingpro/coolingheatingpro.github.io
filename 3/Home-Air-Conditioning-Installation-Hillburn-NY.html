<p>We required two gos to - Jake came out initially and was really well-informed and pleasant and respectful. Grant came out a couple days later on and was likewise knowledgeable and good to speak with. They both did a great task. Sabre's office personnel is really handy, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and supplying the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are likewise well priced for their services. Absolutely recommend.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they identified the concern and repaired really rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>There are a couple of main points that house owners will want to take into consideration when choosing which of the best AC units they need to install in their houses.
