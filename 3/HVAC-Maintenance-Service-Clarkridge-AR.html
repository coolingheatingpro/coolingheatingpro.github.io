High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Because a system is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
