<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air.

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat.

Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
