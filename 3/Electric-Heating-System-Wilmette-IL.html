<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor.

He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
