<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Services in San Marcos</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system boost. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
