<p>The split system is the most typical. The majority of people are used to seeing this type in the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the home. However, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous spaces at once, however are not extremely energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
