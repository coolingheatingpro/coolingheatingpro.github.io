<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
