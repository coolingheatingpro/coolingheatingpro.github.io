<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>

PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the ac system into a heat pump While space air conditioning offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
