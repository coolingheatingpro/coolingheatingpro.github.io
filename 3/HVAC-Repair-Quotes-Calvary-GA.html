<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Care Tips in Calvary GA</h3>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a referral later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
