<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
