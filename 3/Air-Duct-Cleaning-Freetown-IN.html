<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Radiant heat offers a number of unique advantages over forced air heating unit. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They don't have to fret about duct leakages, which are responsible for output losses of as much as 30% in other heating unit types. Sending heat through solid objects will likewise cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A house heated up by a glowing system will heat up quicker, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are just a few of the lots of advantages that a radiant heat system can offer you.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
