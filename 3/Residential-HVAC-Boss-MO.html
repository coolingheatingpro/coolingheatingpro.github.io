<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
