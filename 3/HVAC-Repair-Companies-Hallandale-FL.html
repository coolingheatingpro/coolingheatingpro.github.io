<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Ductless Heat Pump in Hallandale FL</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
