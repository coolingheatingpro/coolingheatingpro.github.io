However, choose your contractor wisely, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the exact same).

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
