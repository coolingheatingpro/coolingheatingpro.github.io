The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be checked for leaks, the system ought to be flushed regularly to get rid of tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water locations).

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
