Depending on the type of unit set up, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're extremely allergic to dust.

Throughout usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a variety of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has recognized building products, furnishings, and mold as serious issues, but much of the threat also comes from burning things.
