<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
