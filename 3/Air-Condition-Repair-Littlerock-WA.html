<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
