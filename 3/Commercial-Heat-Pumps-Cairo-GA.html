<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Fantastic AC Repair Company at Cairo GA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>I highly suggest utilizing this service. Really trustworthy exceptionally good. Took care of a part that was not covered under service warranty quick and efficient and did not need to pay an arm and a leg to get it done. Terrific company begun by a guy who is looking to grow his company and protect his family. He set up a total system inside and out. Terrific unit and a very good rate. I am currently on the maintance plan. He looks after it two times a year with out having to be advised to do it.<p>
