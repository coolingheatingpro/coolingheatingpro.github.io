In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
