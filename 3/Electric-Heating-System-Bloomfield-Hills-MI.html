<h3>Heat Pump Cost in Bloomfield Hills MI</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs in between $300 to $500 typically. It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each room in your house, and if it establishes cracks which leakage, they need to be fixed. Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with worse outcomes. Your home will not be sufficiently cooled, and your energy bills will increase. Installing brand-new ductwork for the whole home will cost approximately in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
