<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Wheaton IL</h3>

They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
