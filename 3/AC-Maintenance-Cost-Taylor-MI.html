PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space cooling supplies optimum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air.<p>
