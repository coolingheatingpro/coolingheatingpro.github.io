<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 need to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
