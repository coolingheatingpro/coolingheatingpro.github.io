<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank.

<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent rarely or never clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
