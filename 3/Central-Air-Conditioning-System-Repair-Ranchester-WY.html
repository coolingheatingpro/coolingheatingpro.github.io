This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
