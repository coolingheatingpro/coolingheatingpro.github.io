<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Ac system manufacturers typically make rugged, high quality products. Start by inspecting any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
