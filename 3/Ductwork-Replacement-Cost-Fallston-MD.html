<p>The toxins noted in this guide have been revealed to trigger the health effects pointed out.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
