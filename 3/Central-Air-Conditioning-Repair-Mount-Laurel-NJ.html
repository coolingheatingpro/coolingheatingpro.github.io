<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Elements that can contribute to the growth of biological pollutants are damp or wet structure materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and badly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness triggered by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the structure residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are pets and family plants.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
