<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the increase it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the possibilities are good that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's finest to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up simply a couple of years ago.<p>

<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you employ to install your central air conditioning system. In reality, you can even DIY, despite our strong suggestion not to do so. If you do take our recommendation, expect to pay in between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to install central air. Moreover, cooling contractors might charge an additional $50 to $200 for extra supplies and equipment.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by just using the services of a certified contractor or a licensed agent from a company or seller to do the installation. If you pick to attempt to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed person to do the work, in a lot of, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the a/c system. A voided guarantee won't do you any good must the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the start and hire a certified individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
