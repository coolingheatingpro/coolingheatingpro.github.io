<p>Let's begin by outlining the planning that requires to take place before you really purchase a furnace. Picking a furnace for your home isn't as simple as picking one off a showroom floor. Not all furnaces are good for all homes, and there are a couple of aspects that absolutely need to be thought about before picking one. Initially, you'll need one that is properly sized for your home. A furnace that is too large will put out excessive heat for your system to deal with, and will cause problems like short-cycling that can shorten its life. A furnace that is too small, on the other hand, will not be able to supply enough heat to keep your home comfortable.<p>
<p>For pollutants other than radon, measurements are most proper when there are either health symptoms or signs of poor ventilation and particular sources or toxins have actually been identified as possible reasons for indoor air quality problems. Testing for lots of contaminants can be expensive. Before monitoring your home for pollutants besides radon, consult your state or local health department or specialists who have experience in resolving indoor air quality problems in nonindustrial buildings.<p>
<p>Picking the ideal size central air system for your house is very important, as is choosing either a bundle system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one system, or a split system, which places the condenser outside the fan and the house and coil inside.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
