<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough task that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps guys working. When a sales man concerns your home he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and ought to not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the choices for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair Companies in Guy TX</h3>
<p>While toxin levels from specific sources might not present a substantial health risk by themselves, most houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a severe risk from the cumulative effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that most people can take both to reduce the threat from existing sources and to prevent new issues from happening. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to do something about it that can lower the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a variety of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has actually recognized building materials, furnishings, and mold as severe concerns, but much of the risk also comes from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop pollution in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>Air toxins can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin resulting from natural gas that gets away into your house without being burnt. Older homes may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In restrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where wetness levels are typically higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
