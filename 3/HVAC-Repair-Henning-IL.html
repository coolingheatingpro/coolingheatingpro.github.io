<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
