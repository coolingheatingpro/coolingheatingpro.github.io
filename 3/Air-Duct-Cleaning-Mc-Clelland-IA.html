<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
