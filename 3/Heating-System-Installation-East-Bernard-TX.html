<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, schools and houses matters, especially since we invest most of our lives inside. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
