<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Repair in Huntington Woods MI</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
