<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Because it just takes more electrical power to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture.
