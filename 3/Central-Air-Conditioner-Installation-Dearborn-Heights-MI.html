The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can vary substantially from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job may require completely different actions and procedures than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being inspected.

<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional water heater.

If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>
