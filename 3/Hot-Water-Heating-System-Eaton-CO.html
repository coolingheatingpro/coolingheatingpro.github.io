<p>In a lot of cases, if materials have failed to dry several days after the presumed water occasion, mold growth is presumed within wall cavities even if it is not instantly noticeable. Through a mold investigation, which might consist of destructive assessment, one must be able to figure out the existence or lack of mold.
