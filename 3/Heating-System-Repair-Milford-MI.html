<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly higher incomes for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or just a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest typical incomes for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.

<p>Typically the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions.

Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Start by checking out the installation manual and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners.
