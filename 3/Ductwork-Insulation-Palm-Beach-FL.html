<h3>Truth About Palm Beach FL Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Given that pesticides can be discovered far from the site of their original application, it is prudent to minimize the use of chemical pesticides outdoors as well as inside. Depending upon the site and insect to be controlled, one or more of the following actions can be effective: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and regular washing of indoor plants and pets. Termite damage can be reduced or prevented by making certain that wood building materials do not enter direct contact with the soil and by keeping fire wood far from the home. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the need for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be significantly minimized.<p>
