<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
