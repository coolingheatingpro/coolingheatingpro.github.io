<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
