<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power ought to not surpass the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, given that the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not simple, because it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request.

Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
