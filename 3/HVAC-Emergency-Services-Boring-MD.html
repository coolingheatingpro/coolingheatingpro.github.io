<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in Boring</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Facts All Boring MD Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
