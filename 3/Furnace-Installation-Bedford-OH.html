<h3>Floor Heating System in Bedford Ohio</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Several initiatives envisage to minimize indoor air contamination by restricting VOC emissions from products.
