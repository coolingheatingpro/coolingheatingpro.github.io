They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
