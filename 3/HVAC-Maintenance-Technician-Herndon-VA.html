<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
