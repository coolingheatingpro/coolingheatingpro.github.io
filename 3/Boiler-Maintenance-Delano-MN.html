<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the prospective to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, germs, and really small particles of dust.

For example, he might seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses. Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.
