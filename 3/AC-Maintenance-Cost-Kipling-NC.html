<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Kipling NC Home</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally effective, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a constant temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
