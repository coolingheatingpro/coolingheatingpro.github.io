<p>Some health effects can be useful indicators of an indoor air quality problem, specifically if they appear after an individual relocates to a new residence, remodels or refurnishes a house, or deals with a home with pesticides.

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
