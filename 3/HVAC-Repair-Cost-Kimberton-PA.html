<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the unit. Loose, defective or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace includes examining the advised connections in addition to temperature and pressure assesses. Require time to check these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are safe and secure and tight.<p>
