<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is even more than other heat pump types when setting up the whole system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one included excavation, running hundreds of backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is rather pricey. Installing a brand-new geothermal heat pump to deal with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
