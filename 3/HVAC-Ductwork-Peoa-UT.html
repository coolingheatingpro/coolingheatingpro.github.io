<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home.

Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>For example, issues occur when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate appropriate quantities of outdoor air.

Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
