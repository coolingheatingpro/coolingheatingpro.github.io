For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
