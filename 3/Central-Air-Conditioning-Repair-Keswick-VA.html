<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the prospective to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must examine and, if essential, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation may be a more reliable solution to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>Heat Exchanger Replacement: â $ " Â The heat exchanger is at the very core of the furnace.
