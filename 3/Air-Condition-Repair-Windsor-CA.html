These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
