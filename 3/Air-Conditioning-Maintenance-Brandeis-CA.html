<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can become obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness.

By contrast, changing a furnace and examining filter can usually be performed in just a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
