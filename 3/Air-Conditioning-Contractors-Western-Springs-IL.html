<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries.
