<p>Outdoor contaminants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates.

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Rolesville NC Home</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
