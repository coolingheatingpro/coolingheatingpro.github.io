<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
