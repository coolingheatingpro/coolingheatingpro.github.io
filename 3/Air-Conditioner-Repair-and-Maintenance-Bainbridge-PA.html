<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last flooring finish. This is normally used in a third-floor or 2nd area and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
