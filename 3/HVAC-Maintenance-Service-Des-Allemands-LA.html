Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
