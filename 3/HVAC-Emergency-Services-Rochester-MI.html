<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems.
