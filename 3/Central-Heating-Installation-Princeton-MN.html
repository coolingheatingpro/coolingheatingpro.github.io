<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Initially, know that a majority of your central air conditioning and unit cost will originate from the system itself. AC unit costs start at $2,000 and can in fact exceed $10,000 for bigger homes.
