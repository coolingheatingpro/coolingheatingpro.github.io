<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
