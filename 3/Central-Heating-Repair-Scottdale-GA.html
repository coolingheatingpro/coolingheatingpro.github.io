Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, since it is protected indoors. When it does require to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
