<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
