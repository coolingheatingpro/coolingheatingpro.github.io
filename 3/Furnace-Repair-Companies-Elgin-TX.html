<p>A bioaerosol is an airborne product of a biological pollutant. Biological impurities in the home may consist of mold, germs, infections, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols released into the air can be distributed throughout the house by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause infectious illness such as Legionnaires' disease.

<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was type of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.

<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the problem area in looking over the costs. He solved the issue in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I considered fair prior to he recalled, understood what might have caused the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not occur once again. I have actually considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the performance and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The predominant health effect connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
