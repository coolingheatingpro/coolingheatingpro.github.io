<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system likewise might add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis might end up being stopped up, lowering air circulation volume, quality, and circulation. They also may become places for molds and bacteria to grow and be distributed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise should be effectively kept to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outside air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
