<h3>Check Out Ductwork At Alton MO Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and extreme wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
