<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat irritation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked exposure to previously owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
