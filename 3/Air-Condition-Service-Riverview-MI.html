<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Your Evaluation This is my third time utilizing All the time.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
