<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>

<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the increase it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the possibilities are great that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
