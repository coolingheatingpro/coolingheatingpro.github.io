<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
