<p>All cooling contractors must start their evaluation of your house by carrying out an A/c Contractors of America Handbook J load estimation. This determines the heat gain your home goes through. The estimation is reasonably simple to carry out and will expose what size system you require. If the one you're considering desires to identify the best system for your house entirely on experience, move on to another contractor. Though strongly affected by where you live, several aspects impact the size unit needed, including the amount of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and placement of doors and windows; and the orientation of your house to the sun. The estimation can also inform you to the possible benefits of upgrading the insulation in your house.
