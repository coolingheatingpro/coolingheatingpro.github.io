<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
