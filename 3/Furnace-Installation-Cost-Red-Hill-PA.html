These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
