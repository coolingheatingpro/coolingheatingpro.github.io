The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
