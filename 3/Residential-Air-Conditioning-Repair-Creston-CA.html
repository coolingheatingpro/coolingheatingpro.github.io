<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The first a/c and fridges employed combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal accidents when they dripped.

Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
