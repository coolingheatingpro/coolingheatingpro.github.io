<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter.
