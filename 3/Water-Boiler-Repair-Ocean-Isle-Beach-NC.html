<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service at Ocean Isle Beach NC</h3>
<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
