<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems at Dillsboro IN</h3>
<p>In-floor heating systems can include certain health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it ends up being. On those days when you just can't seem to warm up and discover you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this issue since they heat surface areas and not the air itself. Additionally, considering that they do not trust fans, ducts, returns and registers to distribute hot air, in-floor heating systems can decrease the amount of dust and seasonal irritants in your home.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that protect your a/c system from flooding.
