<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
