<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
