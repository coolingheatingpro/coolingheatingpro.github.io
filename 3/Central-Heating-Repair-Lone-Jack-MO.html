<p>We suggest utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. When utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes.
