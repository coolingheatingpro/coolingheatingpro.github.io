<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
<h3>AC Maintenance in Mango Florida</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
