<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in many cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores.

When the air conditioner works however your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
