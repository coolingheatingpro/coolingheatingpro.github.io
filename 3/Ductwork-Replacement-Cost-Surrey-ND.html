<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Surrey ND</h3>
<p>Central air units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
