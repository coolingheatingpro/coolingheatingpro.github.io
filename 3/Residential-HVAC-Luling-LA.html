<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably minimizes direct exposure to toxins during cooking. Inappropriate adjustment, typically indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you purchase a new gas range or variety. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your house. Always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
