<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Rio Verde AZ Home Owners</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
