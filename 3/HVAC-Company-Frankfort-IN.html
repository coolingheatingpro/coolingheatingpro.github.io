<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They met my requirements entirely by supplying an expert quote with choices, without pressing extra items. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
