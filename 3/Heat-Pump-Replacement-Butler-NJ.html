<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually brought on by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary problem in over half the work environment indoor air investigations it has actually conducted. Investigations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be real. These examinations revealed that correct ventilation is essential in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 need to be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
