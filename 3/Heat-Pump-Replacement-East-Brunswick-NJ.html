<h3>The Way to Choose An HVAC Company at East Brunswick NJ</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
