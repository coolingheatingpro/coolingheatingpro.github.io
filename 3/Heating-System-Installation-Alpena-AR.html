<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
