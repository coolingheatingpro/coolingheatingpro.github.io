<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual spaces.<p>
