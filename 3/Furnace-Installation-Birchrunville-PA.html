<p>We take a look at ideas prior to we offer advice to change instead of repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy.

It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older system.<p>

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
