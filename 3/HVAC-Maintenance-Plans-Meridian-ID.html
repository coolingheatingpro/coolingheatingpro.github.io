<p>It may simply need to be cleaned if your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running. Whether or not this is the cause of the issue, it's a great early treatment to attempt.

Note: Always turn off the power prior to cleaning the system.<p>
<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Meridian Idaho</h3>
<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the possibilities are excellent that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's finest to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as coal, oil, or gas. Rather, it absorbs heat from within the earth. In addition, a geothermal heating & cooling system uses significantly less electrical power compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heating unit an attractive option to cut your carbon footprint, offering a positive effect on the environment.<p>
