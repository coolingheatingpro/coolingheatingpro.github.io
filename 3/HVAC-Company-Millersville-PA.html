<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Millersville PA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home building is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in floors, walls, and roofings. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>
