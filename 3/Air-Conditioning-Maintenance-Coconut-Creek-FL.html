<p>We look at hints before we supply advice to replace rather than repair a heater. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
