All five other companies estimated me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is sincere, dependable, and affordable on price. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
