<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>
<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They include hold-ups in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, fetuses, and children are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults given that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead. Children might have higher direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
