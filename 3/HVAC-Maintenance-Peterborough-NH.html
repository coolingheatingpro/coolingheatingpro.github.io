<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
