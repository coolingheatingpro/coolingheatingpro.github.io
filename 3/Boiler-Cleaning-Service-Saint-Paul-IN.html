<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control panel should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
