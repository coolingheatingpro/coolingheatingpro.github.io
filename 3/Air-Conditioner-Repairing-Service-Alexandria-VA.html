<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures.
