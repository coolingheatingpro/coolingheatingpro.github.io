<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
