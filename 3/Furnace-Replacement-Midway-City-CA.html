<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
