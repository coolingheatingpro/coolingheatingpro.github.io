<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high indoors might cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
