Not just was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
