<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that come with owning a high-demand, seasonal service.

<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be polluted (since of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for example), and the system might spread out these pollutants throughout the home. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread contaminants from one part of the house to another. Regular maintenance and duct sealing can help decrease these issues.<p>

<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor begins but the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. , if it does not, you've provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>Numerous elements impact IAQ. These factors include bad ventilation (lack of outdoors air), problems managing temperature level, high or low humidity, current improvement, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air entering the structure.
