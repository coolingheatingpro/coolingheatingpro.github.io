The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
