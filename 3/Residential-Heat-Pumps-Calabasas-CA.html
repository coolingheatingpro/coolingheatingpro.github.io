<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Calabasas CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future.
