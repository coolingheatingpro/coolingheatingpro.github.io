When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to install.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
