<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
