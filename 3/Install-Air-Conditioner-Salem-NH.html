<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
