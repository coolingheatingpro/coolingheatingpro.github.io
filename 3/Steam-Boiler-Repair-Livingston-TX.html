<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
