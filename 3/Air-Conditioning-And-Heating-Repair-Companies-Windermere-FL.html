<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power should not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor unit.

The greater the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
