<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
