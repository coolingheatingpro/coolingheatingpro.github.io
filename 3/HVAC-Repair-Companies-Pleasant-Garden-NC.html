<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for years.

<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold enjoy wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other allergens under control. A dehumidifier (and ac system during summer months) helps in reducing wetness in indoor air and effectively manages irritants, Lang says. An air conditioning system likewise minimizes indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -patients.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor starts however the fan does not, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts.
