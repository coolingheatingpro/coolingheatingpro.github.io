<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn offered excellent client service at the end of the consultation by discussing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system likewise might add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly might end up being blocked, minimizing air circulation distribution, volume, and quality. They also might end up being locations for bacteria and molds to be and grow dispersed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be properly preserved to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>The predominant health result related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
