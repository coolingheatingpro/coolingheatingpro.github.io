<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements completely by supplying an expert quote with choices, without pressing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also promptly followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two must not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for generating power in the kind of electrical power. The 2 operations utilize various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to attain its objectives.<p>
