<h3>Ventilation System in Medanales New Mexico</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

The procedure of fixing indoor air quality issues that lead to health and convenience grievances can be a sluggish one, involving several trial services prior to successful therapeutic actions are identified.<p>
