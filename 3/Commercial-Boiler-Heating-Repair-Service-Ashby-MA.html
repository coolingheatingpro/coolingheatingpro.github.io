<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered with a Ashby MA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the entire surface area of a floor warms the lower half of the room, enveloping residents in heat at a lower general temperature level-- sometimes approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heating unit." Simply put, in-floor heating systems provide a different mode and level of comfort. And, as numerous public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we may be to push down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenses.<p>
