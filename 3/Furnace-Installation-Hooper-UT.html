<h3>What to Search for When Hiring an Hooper UT HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Even more recent heaters less than 5 years old have been found as bad. A lot of house owners are surprised to find out that their 'new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger. In many cases it is due to bad furnace style, but in most cases, it's from overlook.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
