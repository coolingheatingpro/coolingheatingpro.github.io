Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no customer grievances have been filed which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is valid and active.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

Such a tool must identify the number of individuals impacted; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; determine where they are located within the office; suggest when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); supply a list of particular health symptoms or health problems; identify all machines run in the work environment; indicate the kind of outdoors air pollution; and recognize possible sources of job stress.<p>
