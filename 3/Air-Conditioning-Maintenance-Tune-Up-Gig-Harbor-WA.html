<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>It is not advised that "regular" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to determine if the basic indoor air quality fulfills a specific requirement. Occupational exposure limits noted in health and wellness policies and the Threshold Limitation Worths ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to prevent illness or particular results (like eye and nose irritation) in commercial situations. These limits might not be proper in workplace settings or for the house.<p>
