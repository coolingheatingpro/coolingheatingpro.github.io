As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
