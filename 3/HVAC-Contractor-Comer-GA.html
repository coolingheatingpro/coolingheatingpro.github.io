Pressed wood items made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is usually acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.<p>
