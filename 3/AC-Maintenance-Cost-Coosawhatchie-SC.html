<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
