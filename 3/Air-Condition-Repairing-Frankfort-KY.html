<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a house heater, you might search for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and performance. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the extremely hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
