<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex properly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install evaluation results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be bought and utilized by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
