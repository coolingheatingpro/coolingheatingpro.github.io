Allergens discovered in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and hence, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.
