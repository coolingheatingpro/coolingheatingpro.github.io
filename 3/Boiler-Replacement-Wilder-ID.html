<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having resolved the issue with a basic repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part. He was friendly, uncomplicated and a thoroughly pleasurable individual to have around that entire time. His time and expertise to SOLVE the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a rather unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person must be called for nearly any maintenance aside from routine cleaning.

While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak performance.<p>
