<p>I confess I haven't done the math lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits.
