<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time.
