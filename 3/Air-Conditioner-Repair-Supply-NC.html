<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room air conditioning offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>

We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC units even in winter season. We want we had actually understood him then.<p>
