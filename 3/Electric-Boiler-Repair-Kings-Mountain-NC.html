<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Kings Mountain NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
