What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
