<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards typically total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during new construction (houses normally utilize between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. Nevertheless, new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>

<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed.
