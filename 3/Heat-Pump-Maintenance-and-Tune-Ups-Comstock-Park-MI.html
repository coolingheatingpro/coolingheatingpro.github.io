<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
