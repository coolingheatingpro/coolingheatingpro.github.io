<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps ought to also be required to minimize pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens ought to look out to the emergence of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures ought to not be carried out till these issues have been corrected.<p>
<p>Through regular use and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit may become extremely unclean.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
