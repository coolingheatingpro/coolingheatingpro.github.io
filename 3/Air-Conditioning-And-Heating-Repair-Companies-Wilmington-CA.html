<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big commercial and office buildings such as health centers and skyscrapers, lorries such as cars and trucks, trains, ships, submarines and planes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with respect to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The cost of returning a garden location or landscaping to its previous state must also be thought about, and for many the concept of digging up a thoroughly produced location is often a considerable barrier to adoption of the geothermal system, however the vertically set up loop considerably lowers this disruption, making them a practical alternative even in scenarios where space is readily available for the horizontal approach.<p>
