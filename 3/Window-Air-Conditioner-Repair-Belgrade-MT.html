A professional maintenance technician will clean the condensate and flush drain to make sure all excess wetness streams far from the system.<p>

<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may notice undesirable or musty odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk to your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Often there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in covert or hardly ever accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, possibilities are there will be mold growing close by. Fix the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
