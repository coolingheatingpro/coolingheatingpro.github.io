<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
