<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
