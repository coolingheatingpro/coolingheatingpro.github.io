<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
