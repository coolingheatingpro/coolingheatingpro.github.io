Before we style and set up any systems, we set up a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Fundamental improvements typically include adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest numerous qualified home Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
