<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
