<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing in Dobbin TX</h3>
<p>The icing issue becomes far more serious with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are typically set up in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
