<h3>Facts All Bay Village OH Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in home building is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofs, and floors. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as developing materials, furnishings, and family items like air fresheners, release pollutants more or less constantly. Other sources, related to activities performed in the house, release toxins periodically. These consist of smoking, the use of unvented or malfunction-ing stoves, heating systems, or area heating systems, using solvents in cleaning and pastime activities, using paint strippers in remodeling activities, and the use of cleaning products and pesticides in house cleaning. High pollutant concentrations can stay in the air for extended periods after a few of these activities.<p>

<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>

<p>Stability Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work.
