<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
