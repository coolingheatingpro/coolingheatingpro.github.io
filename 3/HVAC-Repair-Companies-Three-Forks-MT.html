<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Many AC units feature a variety of unique features that can even more enhance performance and efficiency.

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
