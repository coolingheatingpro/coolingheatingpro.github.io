Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues.

Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
