<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
