<p>We included a new 1500 sf office space to perform our workshops and required some heating. After contacting Integrity we were given a fantastic quote on a glowing floor system. We were in a time crunch for upcoming occasion, and Tyler came right out and had us linked in a couple of days. The systems works terrific and the brand-new office feels really comfy. It was a pleasure working with such a professional company and would extremely suggest them to anyone trying to find HVAC.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs completely by supplying an expert quote with choices, without pushing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, triggering your brand-new under tile floor heater prematurely, prior to the mortar has cured, can trigger the grout to split or to not adhere correctly, and might void the warranty of your mortar product. In some screening, even the tile broken when the system was run before the compound had actually cured. And mortar manufacturers may decline warranty protection if you do not follow their instructions.<p>
