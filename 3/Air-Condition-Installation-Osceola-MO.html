Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the conventional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible.

Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling result. A lot of ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0.
