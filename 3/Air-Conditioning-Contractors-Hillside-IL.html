<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Heating systems that kick on often might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
