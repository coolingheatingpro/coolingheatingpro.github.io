This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
