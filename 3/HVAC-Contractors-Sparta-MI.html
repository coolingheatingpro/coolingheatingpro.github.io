<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Sparta MI</h3>

For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many people.<p>
