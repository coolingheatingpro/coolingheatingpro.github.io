<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

A home situated in the South would require an AC unit with a size efficient in cooling your house due to high temperature Summers.
