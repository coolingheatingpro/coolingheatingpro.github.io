<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
