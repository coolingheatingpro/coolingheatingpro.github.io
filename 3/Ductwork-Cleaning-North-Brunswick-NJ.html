<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
