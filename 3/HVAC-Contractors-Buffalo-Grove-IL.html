<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
