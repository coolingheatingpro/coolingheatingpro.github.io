<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
