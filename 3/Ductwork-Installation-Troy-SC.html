<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Troy SC</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
