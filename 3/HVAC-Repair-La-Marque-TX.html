<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
