<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
