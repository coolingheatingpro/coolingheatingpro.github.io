<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater since the professionals thought they simply didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
