<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and effectiveness if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
