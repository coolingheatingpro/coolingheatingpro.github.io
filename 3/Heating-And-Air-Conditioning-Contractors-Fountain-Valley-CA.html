<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed.
