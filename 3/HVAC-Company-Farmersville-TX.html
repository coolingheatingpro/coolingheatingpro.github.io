But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
