<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In numerous split-system air conditioning unit, this indoor cabinet also contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump.

The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan does not. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins.

<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace in Naples FL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
