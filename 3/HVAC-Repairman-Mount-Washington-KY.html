<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
