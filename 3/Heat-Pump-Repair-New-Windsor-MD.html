<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
