<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
