<p>In more complex plans, warm air is allowed to flow and increase out high building openings to the outdoors (stack impact ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use extremely little energy, but care must be taken to guarantee comfort. In warm or damp climates, keeping thermal comfort solely via natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are utilized, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outside air when appropriate.<p>
