<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if necessary, update the structure envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation may be a more efficient solution to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>There are a great deal of advantages to using a radiant heating system over a standard forced air heating system. Radiant heat systems tend to be much more energy effective than other heating units, for something. Forced air heater tend to struggle with things like duct leakages, which rob them of as much as 30% of their output.

<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide gas, radon, unstable organic substances ), particulates, microbial pollutants (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce adverse health conditions.

An expert technician will examine the thermostat throughout the annual maintenance to make sure the actual temperature and the temperature on the thermostat matches.
