<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if essential, update the building envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more reliable service to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
