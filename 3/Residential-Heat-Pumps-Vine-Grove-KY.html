<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
