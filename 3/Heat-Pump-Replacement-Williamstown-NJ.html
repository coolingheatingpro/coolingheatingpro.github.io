<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
