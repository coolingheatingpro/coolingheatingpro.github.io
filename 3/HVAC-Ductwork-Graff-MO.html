<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may notice moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak to your physician about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
