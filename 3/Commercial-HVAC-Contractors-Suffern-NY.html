<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many typical building products utilized prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Typically, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not constantly ideal since the fibers can be spread out into the air during the elimination procedure. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
