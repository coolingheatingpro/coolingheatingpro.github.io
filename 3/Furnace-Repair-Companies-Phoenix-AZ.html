<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas heaters While oil is typically used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option in between the 2 types. Gas furnaces cost about the same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
