Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<h3>Working of a HVAC System in Zebulon NC</h3>
<p>Hospital running theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to lower infection danger and the humidity controlled to limit client dehydration. Although temperature levels are typically in the convenience range, some specialist treatments, such as open heart surgery, need low temperatures (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, reasonably high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both comfort and process applications, the objective may be to not just manage temperature, but also humidity, air quality, and air movement from area to space.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
