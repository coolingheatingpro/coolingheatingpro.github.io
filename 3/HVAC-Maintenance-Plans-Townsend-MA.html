<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, an expert service individual should be called for practically any maintenance other than regular cleaning. Central air conditioners should be professionally examined and adjusted before the start of every cooling season. Nevertheless, do not let your maintenance end with this annual examination. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak effectiveness.<p>
