<p>Streamline your services, earn more services revenue, and provide an incredible customer experience. To make sure the system you select is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load computation price quote to determine the specific type of heat and a/c system that's perfect for your home-we don't simply replace it with the exact same size system you currently have. These estimations consider things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, fetuses, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults because lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead. Children might have greater exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
