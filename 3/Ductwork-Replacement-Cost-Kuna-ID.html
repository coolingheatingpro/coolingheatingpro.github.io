<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
