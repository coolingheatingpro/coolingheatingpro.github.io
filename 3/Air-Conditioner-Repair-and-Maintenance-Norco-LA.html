<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, because it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour.

I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
