<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
