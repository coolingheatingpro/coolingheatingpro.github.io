<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>

Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
