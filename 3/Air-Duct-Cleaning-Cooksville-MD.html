<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being filthy and old. The old coolant will adversely impact the system's efficiency. To make certain the system is working successfully, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>

To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
