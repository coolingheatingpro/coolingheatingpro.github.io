<p>The world's leading all-in-one software application for residential and commercial HVAC companies. HVAC service technicians go through a number of potentially harmful conditions. Technicians are often required to operate in confined locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofing systems of homes. They can be exposed to undesirable weather for extended periods of time. Since they are called to buildings without operating environment control, they are also subject to the extreme hot or cold temperature levels existing inside a location.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, electricity or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can achieve up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
