<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and houses matters, particularly because we invest most of our lives indoors. Air conditioning unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in extremely damp environments or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>Radiant heat provides a number of distinct advantages over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

Transferring heat through strong things will also cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home heated up by a glowing system will warm up much faster, and remain warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the lots of advantages that a radiant heat system can use you.<p>
