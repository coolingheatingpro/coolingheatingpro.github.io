<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>When deciding which of the finest AC systems they must set up in their houses, there are a couple of main things that house owners will want to take into factor to consider.
