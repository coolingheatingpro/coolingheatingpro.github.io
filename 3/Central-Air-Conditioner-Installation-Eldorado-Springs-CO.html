<p>A geothermal heating unit does not produce its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, coal, or gas. Rather, it soaks up heat from within the earth.

<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Specialists suggest utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
