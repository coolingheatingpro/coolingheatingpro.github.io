<h3>Air Condition Company in Oldfield MO</h3>
<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions when they're shut down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
