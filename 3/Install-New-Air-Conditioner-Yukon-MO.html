<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
