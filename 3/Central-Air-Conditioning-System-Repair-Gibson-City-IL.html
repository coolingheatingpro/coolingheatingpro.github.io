<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
