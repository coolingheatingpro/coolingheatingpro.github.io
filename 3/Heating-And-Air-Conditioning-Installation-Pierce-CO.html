<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my services, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
