Health symptoms associated with job stress consist of mental and physical pressures such as aggravation, stress and anxiety, irritation, anger, anxiety, stomach or gastro-intestinal disturbances, and muscle and mental stress. These symptoms might be promoted by poor indoor quality.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.)
