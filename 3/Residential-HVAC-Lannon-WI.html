CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
