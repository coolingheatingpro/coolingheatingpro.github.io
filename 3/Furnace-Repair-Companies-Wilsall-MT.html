<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has actually ended up being an important concern to homeowners and health experts. Indoor air contamination studies have recognized numerous pollutants that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion items, unpredictable organic substances (consisting of formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are important in maintaining great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
