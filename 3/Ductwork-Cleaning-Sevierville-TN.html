<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
