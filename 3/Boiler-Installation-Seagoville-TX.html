<p>Aspects that can contribute to the growth of biological contaminants are wet or damp building products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Numerous fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are family pets and home plants.<p>
<p>Open windows or utilize exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical method of minimizing exposure to indoor air toxins, also will decrease but not remove direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that smoking produces such large quantities of toxins, natural or mechanical ventilation strategies do not eliminate them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up. In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it requires to considerably decrease direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs significantly. Subsequently, the most effective method to reduce exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate smoking cigarettes there.<p>
