Depending upon your region, a matched system can be made up of the following: an air conditioning unit and furnace, a heatpump and furnace, a heat pump and air handler, an a/c unit and air handler, or an all-in-one packaged" system.

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
