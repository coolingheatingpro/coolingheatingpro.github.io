<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
