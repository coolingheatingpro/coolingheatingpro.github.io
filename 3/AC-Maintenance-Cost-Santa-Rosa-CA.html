These different heat sources likewise dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person ought to be called for nearly any maintenance other than routine cleaning.
