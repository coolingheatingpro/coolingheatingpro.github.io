<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit producers generally make rugged, high quality items. If your ac system stops working, begin by checking any fuses or breaker. Let the system cool off for about five minutes before resetting any breakers.
