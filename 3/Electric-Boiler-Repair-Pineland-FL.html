<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices producer's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place.

For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.  a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
