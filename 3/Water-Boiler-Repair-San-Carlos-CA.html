<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your cars and truck. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
