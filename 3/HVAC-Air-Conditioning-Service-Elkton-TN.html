<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, instead of outdoor or industrial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building.

<p>There are many actions a house owner can require to choose items that will prevent indoor air problems from happening - a number of them are pointed out here. Initially, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, think about utilizing strong wood items. Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
