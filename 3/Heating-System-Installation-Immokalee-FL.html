<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the home.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
