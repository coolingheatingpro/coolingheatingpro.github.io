Contaminants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products.
