<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
