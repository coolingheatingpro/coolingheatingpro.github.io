<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
