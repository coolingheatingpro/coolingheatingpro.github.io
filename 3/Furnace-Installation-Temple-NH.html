<h3>Heating And Cooling Companies in Temple NH</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
