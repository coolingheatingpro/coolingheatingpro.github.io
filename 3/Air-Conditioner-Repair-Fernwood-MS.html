<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Fernwood MS</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat distribution over the entire surface area of a flooring heats the lower half of the room, enveloping residents in warmth at a lower overall temperature-- sometimes as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heating unit." In other words, in-floor heating unit provide a different mode and level of comfort. And, as numerous public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenses.<p>
