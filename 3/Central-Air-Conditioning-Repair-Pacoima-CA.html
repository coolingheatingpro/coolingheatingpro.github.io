What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
