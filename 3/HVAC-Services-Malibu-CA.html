<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems.

Kids might have higher direct exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't offer contracts.  The so called reputable companies dupe more individuals than the fly by night attire. Because I tried to work for them, I know. I stop due to the fact that 90% of them are criminals. They stroll in with or without an agreement and start offering you things you don't require. They lie.

<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") describes how inside air can affect an individual's ability, health, and comfort to work.

Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) standards but it does supply standards about the most common IAQ office problems.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely define the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that ought to be continuously provided in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
