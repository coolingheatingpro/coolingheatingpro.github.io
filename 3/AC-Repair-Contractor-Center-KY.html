<p>Even more recent furnaces less than 5 years of ages have actually been discovered as bad. Too many property owners are stunned to find out that their 'brand-new' furnace  heat exchanger. In some cases it is due to poor furnace style, but in most cases, it's from overlook.

The Performance Check-Up (see previous response above) is likewise crucial to your furnace's life span.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
