<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
