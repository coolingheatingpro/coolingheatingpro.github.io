Load calculating is described as the Handbook J computation and ought to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or system cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video footage alone.

If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated procedure.
