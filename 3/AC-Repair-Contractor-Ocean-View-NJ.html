<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to supply enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
