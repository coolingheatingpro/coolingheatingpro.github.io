<h3>AC Technician in East Flat Rock North Carolina</h3>
<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't use contracts.. The so called respectable companies swindle more people than the fly by night outfits. Due to the fact that I tried to work for them, I understand. Because 90% of them are crooks, I quit. They stroll in with or without a contract and begin selling you things you do not need. They lie. How do I know. I now work as an expert to confirm the so called issues and remedies. 9 out of 10, I inspect are completely incorrect.<p>
<p>The heat pump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can extract heat from numerous sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heatpump transfer heat from outside the structure into the air within. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were only used in moderate environments, but with enhancements in low temperature operation and decreased loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in popularity in cooler climates.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.
