<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't offer agreements.. The so called trusted companies rip off more individuals than the fly by night attire. Because I tried to work for them, I know. I quit because 90% of them are criminals. They walk in with or without a contract and start offering you things you don't need. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as a specialist to validate the so called problems and treatments. 9 out of 10, I inspect are totally wrong.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
