A crucial part of the program is responding to and solving issues of building residents about issues in their workplace.<p>
<p>Prior to you go out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning unit? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be?
