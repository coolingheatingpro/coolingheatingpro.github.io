<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
