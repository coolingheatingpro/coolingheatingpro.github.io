<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Coarsegold CA</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
