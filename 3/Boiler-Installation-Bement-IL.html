<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, given that it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
