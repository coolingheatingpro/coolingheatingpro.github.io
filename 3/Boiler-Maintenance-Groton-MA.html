<h2>How To Hire HVAC Services in Groton</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to replace or update your unit if it's five years old or older.
