<p>Spot Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans need to be installed in all kitchen areas and bathrooms. These fans get rid of humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most reliable fans are peaceful and resilient. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to ensure the fans run for an adequate amount of time. An excellent guideline is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
