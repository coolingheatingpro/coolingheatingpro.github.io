<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Leesville SC?</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensor, consider the height at which they should be put. Many commonly they are installed at height-level or a little lower, if people mostly stay seated in that specific location.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside buildings are normally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is much heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
