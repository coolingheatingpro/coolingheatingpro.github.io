(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
