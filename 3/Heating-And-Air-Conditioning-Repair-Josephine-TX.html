Temperature level levels should range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%.

Maintenance of correct temperature levels and humidity levels and correct air blood circulation will assist to decrease the occurrence of upper respiratory symptoms, and, potentially, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.

<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
