<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
