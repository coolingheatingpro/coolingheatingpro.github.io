<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in San Rafael CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
