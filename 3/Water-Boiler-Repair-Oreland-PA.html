<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>It is especially important to take as much of these steps as possible while you are involved in short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or taking part in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
