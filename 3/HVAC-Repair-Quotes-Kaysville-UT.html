<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills all of a sudden seem higher than typical, it is most likely time to consider a brand-new system. New heating devices is far more effective-- you'll see lower fuel costs right now, not to mention the cash you'll save money on repair expenses.

Start to compare the cost of your recent heating bills with heating costs from the previous years. It's time to change your furnace if there is a substantial difference.<p>
