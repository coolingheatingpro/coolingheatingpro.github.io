<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
