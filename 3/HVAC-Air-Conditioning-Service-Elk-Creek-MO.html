<p>All Points Heating offers home cooling, air conditioning system installation, a/c unit maintenance that deliver trusted, proven efficiency at high efficiency. Lastly, the very best times of the year to install a central heating system remain in the spring and summertime.

<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably typical, you can expect a minimum of thirty days during which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Simply a couple of years ago, Seattle saw a record temperature of 103 degrees, and there have actually been plenty of long, dry, hot streaks ever since. When the heat gets intolerable, a central air conditioning system in your home means you have the power to adjust the temperature to a consistent temperature level.<p>
