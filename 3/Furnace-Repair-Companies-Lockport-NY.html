<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
