<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately.

<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is wintry, the evaporator coil is probably frozen. Also, if the a/c unit smells bad, there might be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat away from your house.

<p>HVAC coils normally offer you a great 15-20 years of life prior to they start developing refrigerant leakages. Refrigerant leakages aren't the only problem cooling coils have.
