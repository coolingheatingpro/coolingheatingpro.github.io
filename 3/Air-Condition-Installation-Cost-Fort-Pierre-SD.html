<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the very same in all other locations.<p>
<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan does not, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts.
