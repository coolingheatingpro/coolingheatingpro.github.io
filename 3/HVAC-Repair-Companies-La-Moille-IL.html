<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
