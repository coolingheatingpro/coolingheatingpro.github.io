<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, given that it is secured inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
