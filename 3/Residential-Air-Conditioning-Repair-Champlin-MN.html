The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Space air conditioners feature a thermostat sensor, situated behind the control board, which determines the temperature level of air coming into the evaporative coil. If the sensing unit is knocked out of position, the air conditioning unit could cycle constantly or behave erratically. The sensing unit ought to be near the coil however not touching it; change its position by carefully bending the wire that holds it in location.<p>
