The majority of furnaces will last in between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, property owners should consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home.

The ideal humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
