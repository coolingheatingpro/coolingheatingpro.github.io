<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. Because it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
