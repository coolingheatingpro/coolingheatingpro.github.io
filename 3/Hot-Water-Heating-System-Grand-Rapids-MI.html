<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
