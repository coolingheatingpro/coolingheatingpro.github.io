<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, especially if you reside in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, particles, bacteria, and tidy the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned up and replaced regularly.

<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to think about. Many times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, because the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
