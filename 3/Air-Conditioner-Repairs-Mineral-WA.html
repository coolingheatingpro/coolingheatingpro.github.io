Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
