<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime.

This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, including individuals.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
