<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system.
