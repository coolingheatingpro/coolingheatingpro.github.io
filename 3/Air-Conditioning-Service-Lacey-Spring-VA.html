This is generally utilized in a second or third-floor  area and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
