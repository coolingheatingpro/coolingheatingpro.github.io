<p>There are two main types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to resist current, which then creates heat.<p>

<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square footage. They use a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the space. The bigger the area, the more effective the house heating unit needs to be. For already built house heating systems, the contractor will need to get rid of the old furnace to include the new one. These charges will be consisted of in the installation expenses.<p>
