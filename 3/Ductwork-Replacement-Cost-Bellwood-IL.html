<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, because it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a distribution system. Metal pipes are rarely used due to long-lasting corrosive issues.
