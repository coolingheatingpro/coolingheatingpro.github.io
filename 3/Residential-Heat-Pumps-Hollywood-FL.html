<h3>Furnace Cleaning in Hollywood FL</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
