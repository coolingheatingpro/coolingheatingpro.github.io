<p>As you generally require to use a self-leveling compound on top of the electric underfloor heating unit, you must factor in the time it considers this to completely dry before the flooring covering can be put in place - this is generally a day or two. The water-based underfloor heating takes longer to put in place, although this does not normally matter excessive as it tends to be set up as part of a larger building or renovation task and installation is finished within a week generally.<p>
