<p>While pollutant levels from private sources might not pose a substantial health danger on their own, the majority of houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a serious risk from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that most people can take both to decrease the threat from existing sources and to prevent brand-new problems from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to assist you choose whether to take actions that can minimize the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>

In kitchen areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are normally higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
