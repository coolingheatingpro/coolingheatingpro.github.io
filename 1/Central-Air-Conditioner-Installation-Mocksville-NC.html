<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, most Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's probably your problem. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing. The easiest way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
