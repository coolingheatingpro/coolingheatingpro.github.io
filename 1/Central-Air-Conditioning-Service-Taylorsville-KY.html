<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at danger.

EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke triggers eye, nose, and throat irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest pain.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
