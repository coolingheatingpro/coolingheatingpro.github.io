<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
