<p>Sean was really useful. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
