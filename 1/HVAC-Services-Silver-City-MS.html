<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can become blocked with particles that can limit airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By contrast, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can usually be done in just a few minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
