<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
