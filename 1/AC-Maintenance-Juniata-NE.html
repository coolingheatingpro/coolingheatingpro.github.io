<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
