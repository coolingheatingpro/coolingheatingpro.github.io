<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
