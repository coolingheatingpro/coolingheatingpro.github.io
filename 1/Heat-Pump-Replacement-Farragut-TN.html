<p>We look at hints before we offer recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
