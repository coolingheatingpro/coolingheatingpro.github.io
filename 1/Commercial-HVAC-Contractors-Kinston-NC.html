<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, since it is protected indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
