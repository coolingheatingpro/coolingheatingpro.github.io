<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up.
