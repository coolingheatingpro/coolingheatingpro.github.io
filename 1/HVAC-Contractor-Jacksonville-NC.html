<p>The icing issue ends up being a lot more severe with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heatpump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensor, consider the height at which they should be placed.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside buildings are generally near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
