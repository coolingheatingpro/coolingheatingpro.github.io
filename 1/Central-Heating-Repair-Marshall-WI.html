<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
