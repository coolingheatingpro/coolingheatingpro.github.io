<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Fountain NC</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
