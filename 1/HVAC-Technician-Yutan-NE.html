<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
