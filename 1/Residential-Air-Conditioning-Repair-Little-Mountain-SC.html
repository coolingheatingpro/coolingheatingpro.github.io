Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high indoors might cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and after that change it ON.

You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
