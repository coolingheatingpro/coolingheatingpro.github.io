<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
