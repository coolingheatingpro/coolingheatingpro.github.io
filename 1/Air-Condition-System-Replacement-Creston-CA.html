Thus, for many individuals, the risks to health may be higher due to direct exposure to air contamination inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they should be put. Many typically they are installed at height-level or a little lower, if people mainly remain seated in that specific area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending on what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensing unit appropriately.
