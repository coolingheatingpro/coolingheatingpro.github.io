<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>

Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally greater than many heatpump alternatives, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the model you buy.

This implies it can warm up your home to the preferred temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
