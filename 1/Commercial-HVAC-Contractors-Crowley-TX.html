Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in question was a heating, air and refrigeration  conditioning subcontractor that has worked at a variety of places at Target and other top merchants.<p>
<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a big merchant who asked not to be called because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that consistently keeps an eye on energy usage and temperatures in shops to save on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the stores change outside of an appropriate variety that might prevent clients from shopping at the store.<p>
