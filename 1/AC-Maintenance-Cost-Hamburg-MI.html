After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the abilities or tools required to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still needed to have an expert technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
