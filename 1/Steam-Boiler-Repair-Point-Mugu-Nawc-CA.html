(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
