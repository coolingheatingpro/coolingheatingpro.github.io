<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon several factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends on specific sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to individual. Some people can become sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your car.

Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter when every 3 months. Throughout high use months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your home. When the fireplace is in use, always make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
