<h3>Ductwork Installation in Keene Kentucky</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
