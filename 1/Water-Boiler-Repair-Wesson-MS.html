<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make certain all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it.
