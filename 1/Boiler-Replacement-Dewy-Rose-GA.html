<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
