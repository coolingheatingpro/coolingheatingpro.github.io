<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
