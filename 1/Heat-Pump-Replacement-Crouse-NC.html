<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
