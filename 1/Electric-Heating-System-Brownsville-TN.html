Throughout usage, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
