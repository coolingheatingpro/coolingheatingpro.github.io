<p>Keep in mind that the SEER rating is calculated utilizing the same set of temperature levels across the board. The typical summertime temperature to come to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to reach the proper SEER rating for your area, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score has to be at least 13 for all new air conditioning units made in the United States.<p>
<p>Heat pumps are a dream come to life for folks in Seattle. Air conditioning is something that most Seattleites will just use sparingly, but because heatpump can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds! Not only are heat pumps hassle-free, they are exceptionally energy efficient, too. The finest time to install air conditioning in your house may extremely well be when your heating system breaks down if a heat pump is in your future.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a house heating system, you might look for a heatpump more tailored toward cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
