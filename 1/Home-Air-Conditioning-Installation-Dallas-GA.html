<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
