This is usually used in a third-floor or 2nd area and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
