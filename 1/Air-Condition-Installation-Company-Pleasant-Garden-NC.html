<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, rather than outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance check outs annually, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and typically some other advantages.
