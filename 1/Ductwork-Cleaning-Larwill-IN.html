<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the result of temperature level extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation. Office temperature levels ought to be kept in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air flow should be avoided.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
