<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is created for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other experts concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building materials, smoking, family items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in manufactured products. For instance, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish items.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
