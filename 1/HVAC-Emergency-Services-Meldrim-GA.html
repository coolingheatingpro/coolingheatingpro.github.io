<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit".

Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC.
