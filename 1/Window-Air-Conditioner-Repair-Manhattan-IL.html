<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers eye, nose, and throat inflammation.

<p>Your Review This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan always makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is skilled with these gadgets). I have nothing but fantastic things to state - he has taken good care of my heating and AC requirements. Quick reaction - quick resolution.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
