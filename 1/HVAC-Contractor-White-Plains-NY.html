<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might see unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues.
