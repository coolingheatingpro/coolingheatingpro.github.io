<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the system. Loose, missing or defective wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service.
