<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again. He is honest, trustworthy, and affordable on rate. It's hard to discover an honest AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
