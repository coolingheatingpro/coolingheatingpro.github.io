Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
