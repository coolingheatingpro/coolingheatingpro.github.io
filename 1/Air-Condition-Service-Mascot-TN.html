<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Mascot TN</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they identified the concern and repaired really rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
