<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, schools and work environments matters, especially because we spend the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the ac system is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity.

<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
