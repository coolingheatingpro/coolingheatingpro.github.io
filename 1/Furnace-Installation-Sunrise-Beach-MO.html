<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might see musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Heating, air and ventilation Conditioning, and describes the environment control systems set up in homes or commercial homes. Their job is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the building, to keep occupants of the structure comfortable. Actually every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of environment control system set up.<p>
