<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can indicate considerable cost savings in annual heating expenses.

<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house.

Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>
