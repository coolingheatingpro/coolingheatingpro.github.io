<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
