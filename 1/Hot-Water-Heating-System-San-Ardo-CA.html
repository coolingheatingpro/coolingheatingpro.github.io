<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
