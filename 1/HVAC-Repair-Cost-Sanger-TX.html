This does not seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
