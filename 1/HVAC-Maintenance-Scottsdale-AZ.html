<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Scottsdale AZ</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics recently, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
