The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most affordable if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
