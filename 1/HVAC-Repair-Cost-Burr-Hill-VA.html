Little thought is given to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, paints, cleaners, and pesticides utilized in the home. To intensify the issue, it is approximated that the typical American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time inside, and more than half that time is invested in the house.<p>

These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are treatable and normally short-term.
