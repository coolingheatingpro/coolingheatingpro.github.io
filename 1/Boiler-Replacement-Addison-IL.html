<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
