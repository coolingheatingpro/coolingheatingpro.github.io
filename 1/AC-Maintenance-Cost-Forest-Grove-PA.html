<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While space air conditioning provides maximum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
