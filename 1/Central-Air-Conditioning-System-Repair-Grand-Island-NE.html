<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Fantastic AC Repair Company at Grand Island NE</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
