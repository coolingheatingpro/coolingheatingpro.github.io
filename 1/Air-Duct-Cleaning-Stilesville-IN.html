<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>A customized air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air course. A standard a/c transfers heat out of the space because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, given that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
