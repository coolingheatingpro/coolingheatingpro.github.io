<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>For example, issues develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate appropriate quantities of outdoor air.

Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
