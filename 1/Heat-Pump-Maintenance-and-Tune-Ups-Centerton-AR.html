<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Centerton AR</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
