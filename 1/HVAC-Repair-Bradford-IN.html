<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office complex such as healthcare facilities and high-rise buildings, automobiles such as cars, trains, aircrafts, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are managed with respect to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air pollutant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burned off. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where wetness levels are usually greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable influence on occupants-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
