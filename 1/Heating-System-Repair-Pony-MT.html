<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the possible to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if needed, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he might seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses. Insulation may be a more effective solution to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
