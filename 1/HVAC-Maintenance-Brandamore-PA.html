<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your house still heats to the ideal temperature. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot.

My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
