<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still warms to the ideal temperature. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel very hot. Only be concerned if your house is not warming up. However, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should hire a professional to inspect and repair the system.<p>
