<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very thorough in describing what services would be performed.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
