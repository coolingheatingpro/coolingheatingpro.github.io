<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
