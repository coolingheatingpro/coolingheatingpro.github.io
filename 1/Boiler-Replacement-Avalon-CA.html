<p>Some HVAC service technicians offer service contracts to their customers, supplying routine maintenance of heating and cooling systems. In some instances, other tradespeople will deal with HVAC techs to help set up or repair cooling and heating unit.

<p>The majority of people do not understand that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break over time. That can compromise the performance of the system and eventually damage it enough that you need to invest in furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will carefully analyze the connections and examine the efficiency of the system. They'll look for frayed and damaged wires and change them in order to minimize the risk of fire and part failure.<p>
