<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to briefly deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
