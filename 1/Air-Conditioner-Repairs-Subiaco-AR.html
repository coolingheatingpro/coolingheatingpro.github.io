<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. Due to the fact that they only partially get rid of the radon decay products and do not decrease the amount of radon entering the home, the efficiency of these devices is uncertain. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a reliable methods of reducing the health risk from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides further details on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
