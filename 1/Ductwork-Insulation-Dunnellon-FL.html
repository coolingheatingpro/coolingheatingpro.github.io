<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
