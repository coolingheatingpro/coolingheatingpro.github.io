<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
