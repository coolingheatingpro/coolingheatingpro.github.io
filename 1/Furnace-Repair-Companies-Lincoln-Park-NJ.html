<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Lincoln Park NJ</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
