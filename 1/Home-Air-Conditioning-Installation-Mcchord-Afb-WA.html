<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the problem and repaired very rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
