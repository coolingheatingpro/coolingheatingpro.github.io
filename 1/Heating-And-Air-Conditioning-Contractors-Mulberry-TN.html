<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>We typically set up little integrated electric space heaters when we include or redesign on a room. Unlike heat pumps, these units are self-contained. They are also safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heating units. They are available in many different forms: wall-mounted units that are excellent for small spaces like bathrooms, cove heaters that resemble baseboard heating units but are tucked safely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted radiant heat panels that provide a mild sunshine-like warmth from above.<p>
