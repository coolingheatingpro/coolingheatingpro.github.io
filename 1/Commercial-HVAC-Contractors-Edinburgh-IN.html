<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be puzzled.

The two operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
