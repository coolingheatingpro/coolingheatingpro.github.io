<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant.

<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.
