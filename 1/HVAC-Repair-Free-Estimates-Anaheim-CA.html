<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others.

Heating systems that kick on often may be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
