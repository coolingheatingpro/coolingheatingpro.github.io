It safeguards the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or pollutants because the energy used to heat your house is drawn out straight from the ground.

While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical energy, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating unit that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>At Bob's Heating & Cooling, we take terrific pride in offering easy, elegant services to the complete spectrum of HVAC requires. From heating systems and a/c unit to indoor air quality systems and peripheral smart accessories, we can supply you with the services and products you need for a system you can rely on throughout the year.

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
