<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps run on electrical energy and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Highwood IL</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. First, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have actually kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are extremely well-informed and professional. Expenses are sensible. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. I did not trouble to get rival's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff due to the fact that the cost was undoubtedly affordable.<p>
