Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation.
