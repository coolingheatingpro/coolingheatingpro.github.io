Not just was the price great however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
