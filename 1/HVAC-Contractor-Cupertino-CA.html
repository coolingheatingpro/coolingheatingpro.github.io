<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
