<p>Whatever heating unit you install, it's necessary that it's sized correctly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should.

If the system is too little, then your home will not be warmed properly and the system will need to constantly go to try to heat the entire home, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
