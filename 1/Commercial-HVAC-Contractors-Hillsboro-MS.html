<p>The rest of the HVAC system also requires to be in top condition for the air conditioner to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the house.

<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate because it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
