<h3>Solar Heating System in Uniontown AR</h3>
<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they diagnosed the issue and fixed really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
