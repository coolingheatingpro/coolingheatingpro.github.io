<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Old Bridge NJ</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous home efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.)

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, the majority of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which might get in close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
