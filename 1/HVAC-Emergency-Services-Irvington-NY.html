<p>Structures are designed or planned to respond actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and keep surface areas to boost their performance, appearance, or durability. In other cases, such changes subtly or perhaps considerably modify buildings in ways that may be important to their own integrity or their influence on structure occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We may find it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the approaches used by researchers studying environments, in order to get an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our buildings.<p>

Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
