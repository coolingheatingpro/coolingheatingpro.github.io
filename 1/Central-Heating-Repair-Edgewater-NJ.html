<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4).

The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
