<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly treat and harden-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>As discussed above, activating your new under tile flooring heating system prematurely, prior to the mortar has treated, can cause the grout to break or to not adhere properly, and may void the guarantee of your mortar product. In some screening, even the tile split when the system was run before the compound had treated. And mortar makers may decline service warranty protection if you do not follow their directions.<p>
