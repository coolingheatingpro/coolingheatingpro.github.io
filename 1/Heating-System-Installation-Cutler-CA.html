Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results via a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to understand.<p>
