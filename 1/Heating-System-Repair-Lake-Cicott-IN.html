<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
