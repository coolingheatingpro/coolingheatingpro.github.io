<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
