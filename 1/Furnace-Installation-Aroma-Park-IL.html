<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can become blocked with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down entirely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can normally be performed in simply a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
