<p>Speaking of air, radiant heat systems tend to enhance indoor air quality. This is because forced air heating systems flow air-borne impurities throughout the home during operation, provoking a variety of different unfavorable effects. Radiant heat systems don't distribute air at all, which in fact improves your indoor air quality by restricting your direct exposure to high levels of air-borne contaminants.<p>
<p>A specialized ac system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a basic a/c unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, given that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
