From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some fundamental maintenance.

<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
