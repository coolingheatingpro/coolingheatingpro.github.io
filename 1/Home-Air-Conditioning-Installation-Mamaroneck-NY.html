<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
