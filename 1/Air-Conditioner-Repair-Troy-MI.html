<p>As much of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one reaction stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early deterioration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
