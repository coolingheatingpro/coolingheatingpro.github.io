<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could grovel twice the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed just a few years back.<p>
