<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work until you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
