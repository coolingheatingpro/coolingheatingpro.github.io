<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
