<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air pollutant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In cooking areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where wetness levels are generally higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
