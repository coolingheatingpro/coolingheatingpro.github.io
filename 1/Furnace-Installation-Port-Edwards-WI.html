<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being caught in buildings and concentrations build up inside, direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>
