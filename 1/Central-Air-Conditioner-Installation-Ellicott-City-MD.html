The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
