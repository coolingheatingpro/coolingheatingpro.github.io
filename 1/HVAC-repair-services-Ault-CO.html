<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your issue. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter requires changing. The simplest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>The primary health effect related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
