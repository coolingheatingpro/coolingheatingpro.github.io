Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
