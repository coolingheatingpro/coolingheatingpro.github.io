<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them till they have actually been appropriately dried. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
