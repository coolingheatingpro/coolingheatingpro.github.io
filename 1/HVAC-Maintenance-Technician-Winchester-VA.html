<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
