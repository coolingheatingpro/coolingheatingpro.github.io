<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
