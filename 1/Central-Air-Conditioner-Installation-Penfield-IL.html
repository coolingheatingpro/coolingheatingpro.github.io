<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>For the majority of indoor air quality problems in the home, source control is the most effective solution. This area takes a source-by-source take a look at the most typical indoor air contaminants, their possible health impacts, and ways to lower levels in the house. (For a summary of the points made in this section, see the area entitled "Recommendation Guide to Major Indoor Air Pollutants in the Home.") EPA has just recently released, Ozone Generators That Are Sold As Air Cleaners The function of this file (which is just readily available through this website) is to provide accurate information relating to the use of ozone-generating devices in indoor occupied spaces. This info is based on the most reliable clinical proof currently offered.<p>
