Structures constantly develop as a result of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, products, and activities within them. The numerous surface areas and the air inside a structure are continuously engaging, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For example, we might see a window as changing a little over time as it ends up being filthy, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life.

Direct exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures develop up indoors.<p>
