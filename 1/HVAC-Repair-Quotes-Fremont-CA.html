Structures constantly develop as a result of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, products, and activities within them. The numerous surface areas and the air inside a structure are continuously engaging, and this interaction leads to modifications in each.

Direct exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures develop up indoors.<p>
