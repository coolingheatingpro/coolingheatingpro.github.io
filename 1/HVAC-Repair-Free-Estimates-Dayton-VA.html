<p>Your concerns or issues about indoor air issues can often be responded to by the government companies in your state or city government. Responsibilities for indoor air quality issues are generally divided among many different agencies. Calling or writing the companies accountable for health or air quality assurance is the very best way to begin getting information from your state or city government. To obtain state firm contacts, compose or call EPA's IAQ Details Clearinghouse, (800) 438-4318, (703) 356-4020 in the Washington, D.C. area.<p>

<p>With the cost of electrical energy and gas increasing, it is very important to have your furnace tuned-up for maximum energy cost savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should. Paragon Heating & House Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Examination of your furnace includes a Performance Check-Up, in which the thermostat is looked for accuracy and the burners are adjusted for maximum effectiveness. Paragon Heating & Home Comfort Solutions DOES NOT utilize the useless 'eyeball the flame' technique that other companies utilize.

<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system, think about possible effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's directions, particularly directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit effectively adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the rest of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
