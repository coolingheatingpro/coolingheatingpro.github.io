<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do.

Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
