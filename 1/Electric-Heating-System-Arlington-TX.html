<p>Think about possible results of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system correctly adjusted.

While an area heater remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
