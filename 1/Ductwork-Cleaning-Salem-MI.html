<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
