Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions due to the fact that they don't need any new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
