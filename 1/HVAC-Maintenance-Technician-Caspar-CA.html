<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
