<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, germs, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to examine and, if essential, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy effective than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years old or older. The best central air conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while delivering the same amount of cooling.<p>
