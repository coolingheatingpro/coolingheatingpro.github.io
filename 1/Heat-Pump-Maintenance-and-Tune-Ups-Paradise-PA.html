<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
