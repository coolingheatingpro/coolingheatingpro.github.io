<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.
