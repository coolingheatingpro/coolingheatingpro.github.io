<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, houses and schools matters, particularly since we invest most of our lives inside your home. A/c unit help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly damp climates or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same period. Essentially, SEER provides more information based upon how the EER performs in different temps. The greater the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.
