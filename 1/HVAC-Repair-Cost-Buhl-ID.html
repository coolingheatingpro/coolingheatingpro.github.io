Working on electrical power, a heat pump is an affordable option using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and presses it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
