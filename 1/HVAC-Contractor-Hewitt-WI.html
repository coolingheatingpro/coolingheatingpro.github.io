<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
