<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating unit. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing. If temperature levels drop and reach listed below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which instantly shut down the heat pump. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>

<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field.

From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>

The sound level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
