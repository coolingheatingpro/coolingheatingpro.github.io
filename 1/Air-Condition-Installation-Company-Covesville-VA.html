<p>While contaminant levels from private sources might not posture a substantial health danger by themselves, a lot of houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a severe danger from the cumulative results of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that most people can take both to minimize the danger from existing sources and to prevent brand-new problems from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to do something about it that can minimize the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
