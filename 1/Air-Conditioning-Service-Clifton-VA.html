The copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem.
