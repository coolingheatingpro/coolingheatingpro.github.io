<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
