<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
