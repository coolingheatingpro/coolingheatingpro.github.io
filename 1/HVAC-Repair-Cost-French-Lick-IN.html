<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Heating systems that kick on frequently may be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
