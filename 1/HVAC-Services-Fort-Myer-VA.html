<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, because the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not simple, considering that it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively simple process. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>
