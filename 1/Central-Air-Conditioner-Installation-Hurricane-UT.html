<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly.

<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system.
