<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
