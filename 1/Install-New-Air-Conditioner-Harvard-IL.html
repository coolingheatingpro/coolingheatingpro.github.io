These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each system of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>

In turn, the objects in the space, like furniture and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
