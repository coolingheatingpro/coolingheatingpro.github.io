<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.

Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon ends up being caught in concentrations and buildings build up inside.<p>

The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- right now, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
