<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, given that it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC use the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to achieve its objectives.<p>
