<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Today's home convected heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a house is the floor mass. Radiators can be locally located in one location like a restroom flooring or be set up throughout the whole sub-surface of the house's floorings. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are almost always utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are especially at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke causes eye, throat, and nose irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
