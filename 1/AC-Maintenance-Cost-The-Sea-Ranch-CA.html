<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance visits annually, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and typically some other benefits. Some companies offer priority appointments to their maintenance plan members.<p>
