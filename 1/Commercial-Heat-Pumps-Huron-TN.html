<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one environmental danger to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, weakening paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Before it was known how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can often be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative must ask for that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this data might recognize possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping track of data might not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
