Pressed wood items made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).
