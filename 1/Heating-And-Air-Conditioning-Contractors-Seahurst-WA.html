<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home will not heat up.

A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
