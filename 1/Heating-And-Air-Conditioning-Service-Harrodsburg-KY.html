<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
