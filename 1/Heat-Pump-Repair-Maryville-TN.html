<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future.

<p>Recently, Target informed press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were stolen from a 3rd party supplier. Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in concern was a refrigeration, heating and air  conditioning subcontractor that has actually worked at a number of places at Target and other top retailers.<p>
<p>Compounding the noted health symptoms may be job stress. In part, due to various elements of office automation, the most stressful elements of workplace work are increasing. Health symptoms associated with task stress consist of psychological and physical stress such as frustration, stress and anxiety, irritability, anger, anxiety, stomach or gastro-intestinal disturbances, and muscle and mental tension. These signs might be promoted by bad indoor quality.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline allergen might induce an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the correct replacement.
