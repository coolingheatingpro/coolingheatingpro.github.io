<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.

Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
