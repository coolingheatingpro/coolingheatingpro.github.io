<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or skills necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
