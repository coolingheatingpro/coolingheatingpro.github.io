Pushed wood items produced indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).
