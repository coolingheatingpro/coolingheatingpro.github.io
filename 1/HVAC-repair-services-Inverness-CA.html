<p>The majority of well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water usually gets lead inside the home from family pipes that is made with lead materials. The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water evaluated. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Consider possible impacts of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater.

While a space heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
