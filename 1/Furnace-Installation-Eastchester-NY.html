<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air pollutant could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care items. Bacteria and infections, animal dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
