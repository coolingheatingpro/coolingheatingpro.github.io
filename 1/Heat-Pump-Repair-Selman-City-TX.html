<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
