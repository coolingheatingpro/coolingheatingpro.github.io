<p>Making use of air filters can trap a few of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy section recommends that "Air Filtration ought to have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are utilized to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils.

<p>Great Product! Shipment was kind of odd being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with problems. I would recommend this product to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>We have been incredibly delighted with Stability's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished annual maintenance of our system).
