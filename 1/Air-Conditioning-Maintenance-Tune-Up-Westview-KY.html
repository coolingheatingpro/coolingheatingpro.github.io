<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't put the condenser under a deck or completely confine it due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow constraint will decrease the unit's performance. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
