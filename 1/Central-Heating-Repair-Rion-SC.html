<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
