<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
