<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
