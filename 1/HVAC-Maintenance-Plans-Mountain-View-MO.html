<p>Although installation is simple and does not need much time, trying this task is not a good concept.

<p>During typical furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial developments can build up on internal components. Airborne aspects from regular household items and surface areas can result in formicary rust within your HVAC devices. Left unchecked, these concerns can lead to loss of performance and worse, breakdown of part products and a shorter furnace lifespan In time, important elements like the heat exchanger, burners or blower real estate can begin rusting, causing lowered efficiency.<p>
<p>Given that cooling and heating work might also need setting up or repairing pipes to provide oil or gas to heating equipment, an HVAC contractor might also be required to hold a separate plumbing technician's license or have a licensed plumbing professional on call.

When getting a price quote, make sure to ask not just if a company is certified, but also what kind of license it holds.<p>
