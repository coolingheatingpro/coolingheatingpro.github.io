Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
