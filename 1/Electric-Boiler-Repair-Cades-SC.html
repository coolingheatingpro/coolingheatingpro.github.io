<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
