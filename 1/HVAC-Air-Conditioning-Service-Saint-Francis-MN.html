Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality.
