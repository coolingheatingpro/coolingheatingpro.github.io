Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality.

Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
