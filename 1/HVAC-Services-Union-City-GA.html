The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, because the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit.
