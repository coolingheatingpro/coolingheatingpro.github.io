<h3>Immediate Purchase HVAC Equipment at Coats NC</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the cooling. I proceeded and bought this Provider and I should say it does the job rather well.

The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by certified HVAC technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by numerous individuals.<p>
