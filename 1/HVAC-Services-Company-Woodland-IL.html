Correct ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are important in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical energy, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual rooms.
