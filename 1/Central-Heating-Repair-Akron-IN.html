<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
