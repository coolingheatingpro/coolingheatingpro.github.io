<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was type of unusual being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we dealt with problems. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time.
