<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Iron City GA?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We picked getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler generally occur when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is improperly aligned or worn and needs replacement. Follow the guidelines above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>
