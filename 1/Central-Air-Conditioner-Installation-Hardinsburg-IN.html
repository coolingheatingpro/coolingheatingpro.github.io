<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace since it's the most common heating unit in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
