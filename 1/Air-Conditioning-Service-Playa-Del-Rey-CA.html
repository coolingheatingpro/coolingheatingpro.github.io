<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to supply enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
