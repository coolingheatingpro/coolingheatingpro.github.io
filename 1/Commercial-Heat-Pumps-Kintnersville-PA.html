<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
