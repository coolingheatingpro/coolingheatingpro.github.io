<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight.
