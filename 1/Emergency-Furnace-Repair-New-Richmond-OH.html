<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor.
