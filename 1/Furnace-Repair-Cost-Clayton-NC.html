<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>. Before selecting the installation location of air conditioning unit, a number of main factors require to be considered. First of all, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor units must not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Secondly, there must not be any challenges en route of the airflow that may prevent it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outdoor system must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from your home will not be successfully discharged outside and the efficiency of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly suggested to install the ac system units in quickly available places, for additional maintenance throughout operation.<p>
