<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your home, however there are lots of other contaminants that can not only unclean up the air, but cause other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure products add to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery products can cause issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
