<p>The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends on numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>

<p>The primary health effect related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
