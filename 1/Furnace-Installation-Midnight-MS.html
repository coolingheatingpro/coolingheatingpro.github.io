<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is often essential to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can sometimes be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring data is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative must request that the employer have air tracking tests carried out.
