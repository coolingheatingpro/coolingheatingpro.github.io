<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
