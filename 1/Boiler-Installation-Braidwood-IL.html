<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys.

However, one con is that these systems are usually only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying simply a cooling system.
