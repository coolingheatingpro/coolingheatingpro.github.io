<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
