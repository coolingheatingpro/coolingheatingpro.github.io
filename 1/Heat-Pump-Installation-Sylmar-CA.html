<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
