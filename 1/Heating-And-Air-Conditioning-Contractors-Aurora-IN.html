<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really useful in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can afford, numerous Seattleites should discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system.

On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens.

<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices maker's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in location. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically tough to measure, as one response stated the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or ac system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repetitive use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early deterioration, leading to holes and cracks. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.  a really useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
