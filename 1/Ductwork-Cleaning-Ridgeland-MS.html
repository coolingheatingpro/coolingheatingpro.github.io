My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the skills or tools necessary to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician examine the system periodically.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities.

The bright side is that the one significant downside of heatpump is that they can fail in the incredibly hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
