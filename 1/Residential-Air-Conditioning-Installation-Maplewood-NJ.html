<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, offices and schools matters, particularly given that we spend most of our lives inside. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely humid environments or in cases where the a/c is extra-large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump operate on electricity and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).
