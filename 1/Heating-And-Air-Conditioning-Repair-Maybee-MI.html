<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
