Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
