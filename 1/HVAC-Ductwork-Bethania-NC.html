<p>Power Vac America provides commercial, industrial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The essential part of your cooling is the outside system. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its positioning on your home and its maintenance, it may sustain some damage during the winter.

Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the exterior of the system and ensure that there is no rust, damage from accumulated wetness, or extreme wear to the outside. They might advise that you trim thick trees or bushes to guarantee appropriate air flow around the system.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance visits per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and usually some other advantages. Some companies provide top priority appointments to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
