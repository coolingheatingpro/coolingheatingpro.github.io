<p>Power Vac America provides commercial, industrial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The essential part of your cooling is the outside system. Without it, you have no cooling.

They might advise that you trim thick trees or bushes to guarantee appropriate air flow around the system.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year.

Some companies provide top priority appointments to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
