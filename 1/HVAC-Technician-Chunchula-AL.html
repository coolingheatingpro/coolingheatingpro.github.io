<p>First, in terms of perks, heating the entire home or structure from one unit makes things easier logistically, and the isolation of the heating unit from the home is a perk for some property owners. The system can be utilized to offer hot water as well as climate control. Additionally, homeowners can adjust temperature levels in various parts of the home by closing vents in ductwork or by utilizing room or area-specific temperature controls.
