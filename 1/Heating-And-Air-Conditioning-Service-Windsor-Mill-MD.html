Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling result.

What this implies is that for every unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
