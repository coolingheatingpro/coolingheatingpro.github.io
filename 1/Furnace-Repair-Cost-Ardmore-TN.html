<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate since it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
