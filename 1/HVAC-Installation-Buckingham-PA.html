<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly harden and cure-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
