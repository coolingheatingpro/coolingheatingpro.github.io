<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Cassville Missouri</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably minimizes direct exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Incorrect modification, typically indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions.
