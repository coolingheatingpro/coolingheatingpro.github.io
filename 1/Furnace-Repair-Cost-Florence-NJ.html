If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
