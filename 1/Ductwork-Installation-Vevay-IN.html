When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Trane central air conditioning conditioners are known for promoting guarantees and provides a basic 10-year service warranty that covers both parts and labor.
