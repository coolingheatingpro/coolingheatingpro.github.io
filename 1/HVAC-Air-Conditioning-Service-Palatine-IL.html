<h3>Boiler Installation in Palatine IL</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
