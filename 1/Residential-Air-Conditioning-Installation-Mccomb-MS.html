An alternative to packaged systems is the use of separate indoor and outside coils in split systems Split systems are chosen and commonly utilized worldwide other than in The United States and Canada. In The United States and Canada, divided systems are frequently seen in residential applications, however they are acquiring appeal in little commercial buildings. The split systems are a fantastic option for little buildings where ductwork is not possible or where the space conditioning efficiency is of prime concern. 19 The advantages of ductless air conditioning systems consist of simple installation, no ductwork, greater zonal control, versatility of control and quiet operation. citation needed In space conditioning, the duct losses can represent 30% of energy consumption. 20 Using minisplit can lead to energy savings in space conditioning as there are no losses connected with ducting.<p>

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
