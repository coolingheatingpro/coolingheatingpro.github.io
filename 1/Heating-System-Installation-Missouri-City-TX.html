<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on often might be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
