<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air contaminant arising from natural gas that gets away into your home without being burnt. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where wetness levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
