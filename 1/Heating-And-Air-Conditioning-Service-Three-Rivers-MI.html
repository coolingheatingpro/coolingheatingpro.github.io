<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
