<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They consist of delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, fetuses, and kids are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
