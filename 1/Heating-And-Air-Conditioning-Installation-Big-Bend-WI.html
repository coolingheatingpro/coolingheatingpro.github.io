<p>Info supplied in this safety guide is based upon present clinical and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not need you to change your existing central air systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be readily available for your home's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to 20 years. Makers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance agreements after the brand-new standard enters into effect.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being common functions of environmentally friendly homes as part of the growing green structure movement. Green projects accounted for 20 percent of all freshly constructed houses in the U.S. last year. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal article predicted that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>
