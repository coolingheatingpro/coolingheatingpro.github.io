<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the system has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.
