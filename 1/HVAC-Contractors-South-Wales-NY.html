<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they've been to your house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have handled the one repair I required well, and are professional and constantly on-time. Have actually been through a couple of companies over the years and Wachoff's is certainly the best I've had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been excellent.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

This process needs to be repeated typically to protect the HVAC system from excessive damage.<p>
<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heater. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which immediately closed down the heatpump if temperatures reach and drop listed below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>
<p>Glowing heater do not utilize ducts, that makes them quite a bit more energy efficient than other systems. They likewise don't develop hot and cold areas.
