<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and workplaces matters, particularly because we invest the majority of our lives indoors. A/c unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in incredibly damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne product of a biological pollutant. Biological impurities in the home may consist of mold, germs, viruses, termites, and pollen.

They also can cause allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Symptoms brought on by biological pollutants include sneezing, eye inflammation, coughing, dizziness, and respiratory infections.<p>

<p>The residential or commercial properties and composition of the soil in an area can affect the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground.

Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, family pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too chilly to throw open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather it's important to be familiar with some of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that might be hiding in your environments.<p>
