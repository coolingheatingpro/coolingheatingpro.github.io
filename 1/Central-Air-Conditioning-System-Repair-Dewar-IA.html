<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
