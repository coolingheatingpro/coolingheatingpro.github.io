<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
