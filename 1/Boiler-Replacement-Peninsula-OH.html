<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
