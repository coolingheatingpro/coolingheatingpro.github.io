<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
