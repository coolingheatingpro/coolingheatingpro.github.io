<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
