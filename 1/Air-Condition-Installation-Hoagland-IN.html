<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They fulfilled my needs entirely by providing a professional quote with choices, without pressing extra items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise quickly followed up with the required inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
