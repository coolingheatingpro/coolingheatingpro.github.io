<p>Streamline your services, make more services revenue, and supply an incredible client experience. To make sure the system you select is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load computation estimate to identify the precise type of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we don't just change it with the same size unit you currently have. These estimations consider things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more.

<p>More common in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, gas or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here).
