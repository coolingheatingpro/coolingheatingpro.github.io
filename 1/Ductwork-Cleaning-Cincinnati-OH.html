<p>A geothermal heatpump is likewise a really safe heating and cooling service, since it does not need any sort of combustion, unlike alternatives. This makes the WaterFurnace geothermal system a better alternative for those who are concerned about security, both in regards to people and the environment, with geothermal solutions using an environmentally friendly energy source for heating and cooling houses.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
