<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
