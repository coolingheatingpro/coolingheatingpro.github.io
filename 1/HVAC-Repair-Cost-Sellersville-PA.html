<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
