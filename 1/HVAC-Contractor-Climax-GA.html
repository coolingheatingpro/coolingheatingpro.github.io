<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
