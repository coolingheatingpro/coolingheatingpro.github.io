<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to run since it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
