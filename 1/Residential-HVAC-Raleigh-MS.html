The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

A voided guarantee will not do you any great ought to the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the start and work with a certified person with the experience to install the system.<p>
