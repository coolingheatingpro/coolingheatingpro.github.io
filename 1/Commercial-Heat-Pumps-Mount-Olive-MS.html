<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products used adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is usually acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a contaminant depends on specific sensitivity, which varies greatly from person to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological toxins after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
<p>If your single stage a/c isn't old enough to validate replacement, think about an entire house dehumidifier.

The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
