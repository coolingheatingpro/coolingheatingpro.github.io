<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it could grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a couple of years ago.<p>
