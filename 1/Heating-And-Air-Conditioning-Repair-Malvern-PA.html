<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having solved the issue with a basic repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part. He got along, uncomplicated and a thoroughly pleasurable individual to have around that whole time. His time and proficiency to RESOLVE the concern cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a rather uncertain diagnostic.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
