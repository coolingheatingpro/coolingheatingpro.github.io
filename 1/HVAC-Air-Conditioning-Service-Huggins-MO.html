This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy.

In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
