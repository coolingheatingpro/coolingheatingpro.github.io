<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
