One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to resist existing, which then produces heat.<p>

Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis.
