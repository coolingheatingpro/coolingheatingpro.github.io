<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
