<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Fort Leavenworth KS?</h3>
<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
