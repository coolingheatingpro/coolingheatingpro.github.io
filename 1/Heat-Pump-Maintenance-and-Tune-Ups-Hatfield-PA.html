<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
