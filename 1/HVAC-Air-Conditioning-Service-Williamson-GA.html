<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most efficient heating sources in regards to ecological costs. It protects the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or pollutants due to the fact that the energy used to heat your home is drawn out straight from the ground. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems similar to those utilized in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical power, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating unit that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
