<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we dealt with concerns. I would recommend this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Mc Kittrick CA</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
