<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in California City CA</h3>

They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
