<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor contaminants.
