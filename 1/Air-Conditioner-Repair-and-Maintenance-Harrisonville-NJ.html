<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Harrisonville NJ</h3>
<p>The icing issue becomes far more serious with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
