<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you ought to contact a specialist to check and repair the system.<p>
