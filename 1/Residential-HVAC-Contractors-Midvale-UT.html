<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no pollutant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of workers in the location, stale air might also be a problem.<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you set up, it's vital that it's sized properly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should.
