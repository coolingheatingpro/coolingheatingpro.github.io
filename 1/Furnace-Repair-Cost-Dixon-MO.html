<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow higher air flow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and new air purification innovations are becoming more typical as offered options in residential and commercial HVAC product bundles.

Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
