<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
