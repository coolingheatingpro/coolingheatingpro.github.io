<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
