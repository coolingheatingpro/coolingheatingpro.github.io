<p>All The Time Air Conditioning is as assured: available immediately to supply exceptional service. Ilan Cohavi, the owner, works nicely and effectively to deliver a completed project in record time. He set up 3 Nest Learning Thermostats in my home. His knowledge of the item was excellent.

The perk: he is a really pleasant individual to deal with, and is very eager to finish the work according to the specifications of his customer. I would highly recommend him for all your HVAC requires.<p>
