<h3>Finding Best HVAC Contractors in La Mesa CA</h3>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in La Mesa CA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an abnormally high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue.
