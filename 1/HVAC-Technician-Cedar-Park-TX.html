<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is frosty.

Maybe Realtors should consider too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system might add to, or deduct from, any offered asking rate. That said, homebuyers wanting to go green," who prioritize energy savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heating system will be willing to pay a premium for a home that includes one.<p>
