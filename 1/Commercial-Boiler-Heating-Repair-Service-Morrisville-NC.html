<p>Through normal use and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit may end up being really unclean. These aspects of the devices are essential for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans all components, and examines connections to guarantee they are secure.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
