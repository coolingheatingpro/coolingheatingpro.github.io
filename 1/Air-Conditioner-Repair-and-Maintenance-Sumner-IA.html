<p>A routine furnace tune up can go a long method towards minimizing many of the concerns caused by build-up of dirt and particles, and the evaluations permit your contractor to keep an eye on longer-term problems and take proactive actions to assist avoid premature failure or troublesome breakdowns during the heating season. Annual furnace service might also be a requirement to keep your furnace warranty legitimate as well.

When you have a ten-year parts limited warranty as is standard on Carrier ® furnaces, you'll wish to be sure you keep that protection valid for the full 10 years.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
