<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
