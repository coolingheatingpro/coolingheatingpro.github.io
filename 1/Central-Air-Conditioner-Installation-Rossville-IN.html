<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
