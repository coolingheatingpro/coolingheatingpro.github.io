<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure."

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
