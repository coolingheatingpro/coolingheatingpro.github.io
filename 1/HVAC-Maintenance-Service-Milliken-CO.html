While contaminants frequently found in indoor air can trigger numerous harmful results, there is significant unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of exposure are essential to produce particular illness.

<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still warms to the best temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel extremely hot. If your house is not heating up, only be concerned. However, if your system does not seem working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should employ a specialist to inspect and repair the system.<p>
