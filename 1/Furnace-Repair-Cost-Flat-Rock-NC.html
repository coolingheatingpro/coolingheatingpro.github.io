<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
