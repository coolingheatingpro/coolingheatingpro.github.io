<p>Specialist heating unit setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC experts recommend following this standard rule when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a new system, it's finest to purchase new.

Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
