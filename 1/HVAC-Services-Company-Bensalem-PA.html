<p>There are a lot of advantages to using a radiant heat system over a standard forced air heater. Radiant heating systems tend to be far more energy efficient than other heaters, for one thing. Required air heating systems tend to suffer from things like duct leaks, which rob them of up to 30% of their output. Required air heating unit likewise tend to create cold and hot areas throughout your house, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>

<p>Energy performance can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is extremely critical to maintaining a proper temperature.<p>
<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor begins but the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. , if it does not, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
