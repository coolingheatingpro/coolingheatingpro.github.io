The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all new a/c units produced in the United States.<p>

Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the brand-new control board must be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
