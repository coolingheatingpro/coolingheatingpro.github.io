<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
