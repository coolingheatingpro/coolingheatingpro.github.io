<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

Area control includes moving the contaminant source far from residents or even transferring prone occupants.<p>
<p>A number of efforts imagine to minimize indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from items. There are regulations in France and in Germany, and numerous voluntary ecolabels and ranking systems containing low VOC emissions requirements such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Comfort 22 in Europe, in addition to California Requirement CDPH Area 01350 23 and numerous others in the U.S.A..

Perhaps Real estate agents must consider too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system may add to, or deduct from, any given asking cost. That stated, property buyers seeking to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heater will want to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
