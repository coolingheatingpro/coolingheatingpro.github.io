Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.

I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.
