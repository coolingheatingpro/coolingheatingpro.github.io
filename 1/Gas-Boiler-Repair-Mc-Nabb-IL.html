<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most efficient heating sources in terms of environmental costs. It protects the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or pollutants since the energy utilized to heat your home is extracted straight from the ground. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems similar to those used in fridges. While geothermal systems do use some electricity, they release far fewer greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that the majority of Seattleites will just utilize moderately, but since heat pumps can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds!
