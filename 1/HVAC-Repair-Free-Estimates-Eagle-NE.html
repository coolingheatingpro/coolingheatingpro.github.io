<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we dealt with problems. I would recommend this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time.

<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year.

Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
