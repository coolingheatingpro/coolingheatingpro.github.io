<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis.

If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>
