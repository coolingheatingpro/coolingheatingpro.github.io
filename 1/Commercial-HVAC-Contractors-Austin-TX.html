<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>The homes and composition of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground.
