<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
