Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

This indicates that cost savings are still understood during the cooler duration. In reality, a desuperheater lowers winter water heating costs by around 50 percent.<p>
