<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be effectively identified or treated without a detailed building investigation. These examinations might start with written questionnaires and telephone assessments in which building private investigators examine the history of occupant symptoms and structure operation procedures. In some cases, these inquiries might rapidly uncover the problem and on-site visits are unneeded.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
