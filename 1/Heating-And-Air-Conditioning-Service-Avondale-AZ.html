(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
