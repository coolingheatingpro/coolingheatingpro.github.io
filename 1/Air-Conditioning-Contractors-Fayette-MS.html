<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person must be required almost any maintenance aside from routine cleaning. Central air conditioners need to be professionally checked and adjusted prior to the beginning of every cooling season. Nevertheless, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly checkup. While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system operating at peak effectiveness.<p>
