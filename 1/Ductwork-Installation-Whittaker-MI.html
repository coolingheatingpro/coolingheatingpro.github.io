Have actually been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is definitely the best I have actually had the chance to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been terrific.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance visits annually, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and typically some other advantages.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
