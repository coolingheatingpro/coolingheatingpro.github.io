This determines the heat gain your house goes through. The estimation is relatively simple to carry out and will reveal what size unit you require. Proceed to another contractor if the one you're considering wants to determine the best unit for your house exclusively on experience. Though strongly influenced by where you live, numerous factors affect the size unit needed, including the amount of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of doors and windows; and the orientation of your house to the sun.
