The design expert needs to consult ASHRAE data for the requirements of design and care as the common building codes provide little to no info on HVAC style practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do consist of much detail on installation requirements, however. Other helpful reference materials consist of products from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, these days. While lots of people assume pollution is just an outdoor issue, your house (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we ensure that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not think enough about direct exposure to all the important things we place in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- right away, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe much easier.<p>
<p>Gas heaters do come with some drawbacks. The biggest downside is also the outcome of the combustion process.
