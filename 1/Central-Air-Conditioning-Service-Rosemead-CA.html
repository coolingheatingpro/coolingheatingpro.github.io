<p>Selecting the best size a/c unit is a vital part of the HVAC buying process and one that you'll need an HVAC professional to assist you with.

And if it's too small, you will not get enough cool or warm air to keep you comfortable.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Client at Start-up," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor begins however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. If  it does not, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to run with the objective of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
