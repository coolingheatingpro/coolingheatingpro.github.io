Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
