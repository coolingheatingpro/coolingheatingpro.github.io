<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter season can intensify problems. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
