If the signs fade or go away when a person is away from the location, for instance, an effort ought to be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
