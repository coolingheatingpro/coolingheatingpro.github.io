<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, go to Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
