<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and houses matters, especially given that we spend most of our lives inside. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>Oil heating units are less common now than gas, however they can be beneficial in more remote regions where utilities are more difficult to access, and in cooler environments due to the fact that it provides more heat per BTU than other services. The installation cost will be lower, however energy costs will be higher, as much as three times higher than gas or electric heaters.
