The outdoor system must likewise be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be efficiently discharged outdoors and the efficiency of the entire system will drop sharply. It is extremely suggested to set up the air conditioner units in easily available places, for more maintenance throughout operation.<p>
