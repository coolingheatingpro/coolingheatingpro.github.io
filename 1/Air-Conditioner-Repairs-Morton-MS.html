If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage.

Heaters that kick on often may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
