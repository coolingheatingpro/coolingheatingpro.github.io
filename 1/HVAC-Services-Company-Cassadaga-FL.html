<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
