<p>Many HVAC business owners do not understand they require various pricing plans for various services that their company provides. For example, residential HVAC installation must be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service should be priced in a different way from duct cleaning.

<p>Since they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>
