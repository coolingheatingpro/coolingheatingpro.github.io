<p>Initially make sure the air filter is clean and in good condition if you discover a decrease in heat output. Next, inspect other components of the furnace for any accumulation of dirt, debris and dust, an economical repair that can help improve performance. Also, examine the vents and ducts for blockage.

Attempt moving it away from direct sunlight since this might impact temperature readings on the thermostat and trigger it to misread the temperature level in your house.
