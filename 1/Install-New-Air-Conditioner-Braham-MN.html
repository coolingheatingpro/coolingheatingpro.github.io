<p>Because things ran efficiently without any noise, I was very happy in the beginning. Moreover, I saw visible changes in my electricity costs. After two years, things began to alter. There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it repaired and examined. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. Overall, it has actually been a good experience. Dependable on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the beginning. But then recognized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
