<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it concerns central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the home on hot days.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
