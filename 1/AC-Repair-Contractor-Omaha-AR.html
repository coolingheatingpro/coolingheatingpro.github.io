<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
