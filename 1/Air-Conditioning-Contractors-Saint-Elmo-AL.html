<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating components set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
