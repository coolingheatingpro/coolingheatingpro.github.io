<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
