<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Afton VA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofs, walls, and floors. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing.

When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the professionals believed they just didn't appear right and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>

<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites should discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system.
