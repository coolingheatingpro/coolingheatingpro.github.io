<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
