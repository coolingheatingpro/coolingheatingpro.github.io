<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Oak Park MI</h3>
<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. Many home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odor free gas that hinders the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a variety of signs from headaches, d izziness, weak point, confusion, disorientation, and queasiness, to tiredness in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with persistent heart disease. The signs of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are sometimes confused with the influenza or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, infants, senior individuals, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing disease can be especially sensitive to carbon monoxide gas exposures.<p>
