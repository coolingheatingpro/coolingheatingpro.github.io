Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the system has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
