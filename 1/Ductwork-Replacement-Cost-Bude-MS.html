<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big merchant who asked not to be called since he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that consistently keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperature levels in shops to minimize costs (particularly in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores fluctuate beyond an acceptable range that might prevent customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and cure-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
