<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>HVAC Filters in Ridgewood NJ</h3>
<p>All heating systems have some level of air purification. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was extremely comprehensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn offered fantastic customer support at the end of the consultation by explaining precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>A third method to choose whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your home may not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stinky or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy. To discover smells in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
