<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part.

<p>When setting up radiant heat, you ought to give major thought to the type of floor covering in the house. Ceramic tile works well since it performs and stores heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work reasonably well.
