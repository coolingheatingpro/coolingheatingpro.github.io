<h3>Heat Pump Water Heater in Richmond CA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>They were terrific! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements totally by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the required assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
