<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.
