<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the opportunities are great that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>Some health results may show up quickly after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are generally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Not long after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants, symptoms of some illness such as asthma might show up, be exacerbated or intensified.<p>
