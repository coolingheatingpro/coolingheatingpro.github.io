<p>In 2011, NASA watched for an a/c system to install in their lunar electric rover. They decided they required expert assistance and consulted many providers.

<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen in time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
