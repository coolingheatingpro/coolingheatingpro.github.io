If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available.

Install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
