<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Heating And Cooling Near Me in Willow Street PA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
