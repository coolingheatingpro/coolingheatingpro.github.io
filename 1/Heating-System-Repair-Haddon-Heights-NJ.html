<p>Whatever heater you set up, it's important that it's sized correctly for your home. Too large and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the amount of heat you want produced. If the system is too little, then your home won't be heated up effectively and the system will have to continuously go to attempt to heat the whole home, which will increase heating costs.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
