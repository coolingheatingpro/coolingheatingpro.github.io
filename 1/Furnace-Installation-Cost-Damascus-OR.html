<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up.

<p>For contaminants aside from radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health signs or indications of bad ventilation and particular sources or toxins have been determined as possible causes of indoor air quality issues. Evaluating for numerous pollutants can be pricey. Before monitoring your house for contaminants besides radon, consult your state or local health department or experts who have experience in solving indoor air quality issues in nonindustrial structures.<p>
<p>A customized air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air path. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
