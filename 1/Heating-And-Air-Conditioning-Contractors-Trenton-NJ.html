<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, since it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
