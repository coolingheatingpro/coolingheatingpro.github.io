<p>We advise utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of permitting heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
