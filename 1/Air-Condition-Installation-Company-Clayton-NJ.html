According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins.

<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

Some results may be worsened by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
