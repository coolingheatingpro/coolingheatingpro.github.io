<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Mertens TX</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

In other words, in-floor heater supply a various mode and level of convenience.
