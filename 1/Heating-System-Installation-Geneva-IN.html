<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities.
