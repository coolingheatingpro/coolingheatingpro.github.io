Other possible sources of biological impurities are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>If you see a decrease in heat output, initially ensure the air filter is clean and in great condition. Next, inspect other parts of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, dust and particles, an affordable fix that can help increase performance. Likewise, inspect the vents and ducts for blockage. Finally, make certain the thermostat is working and located correctly.
