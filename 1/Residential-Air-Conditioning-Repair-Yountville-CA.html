Different fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>If you see a decrease in heat output, initially ensure the air filter is clean and in great condition. Next, inspect other parts of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, dust and particles, an affordable fix that can help increase performance. Likewise, inspect the vents and ducts for blockage. Finally, make certain the thermostat is working and located correctly.
