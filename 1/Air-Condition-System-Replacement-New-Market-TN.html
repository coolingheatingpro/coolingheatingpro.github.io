His time and competence to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a rather unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work.

He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
