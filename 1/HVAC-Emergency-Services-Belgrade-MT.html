<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure fact that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will frequently develop in ductwork, restricting airflow.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
