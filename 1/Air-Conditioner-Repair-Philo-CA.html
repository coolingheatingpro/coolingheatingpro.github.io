<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the efficiency of your heating and cooling system. There are a number of design methods in usage today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps run with similar concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
