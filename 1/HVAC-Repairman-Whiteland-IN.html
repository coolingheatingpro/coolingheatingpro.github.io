<p>Airflow patterns in building are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure differences produced by these forces move air-borne contaminants from locations of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any offered opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the within pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c into a heatpump While space a/c supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
