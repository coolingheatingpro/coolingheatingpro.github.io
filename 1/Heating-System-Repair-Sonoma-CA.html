<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter season can exacerbate issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing dust mites, animal dander, and mold spores distributing through your house.
