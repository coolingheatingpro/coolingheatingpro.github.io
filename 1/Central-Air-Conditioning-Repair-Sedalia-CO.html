<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have multiple control panel. The biggest, or just one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t effectively diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the issue, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
