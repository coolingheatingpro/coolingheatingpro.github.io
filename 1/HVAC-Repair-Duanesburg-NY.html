We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility costs.
