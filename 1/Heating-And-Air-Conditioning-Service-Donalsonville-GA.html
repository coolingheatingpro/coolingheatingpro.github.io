<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
