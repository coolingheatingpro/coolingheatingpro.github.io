<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stagnant air may also be a problem when ventilation is not adequate to represent an increase in the number of workers in the location.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Geneva GA</h3>
<p>Everybody deal with a range of threats to our health as we tackle our everyday lives. Driving in cars, flying in airplanes, participating in leisure activities, and being exposed to toxic wastes all present differing degrees of risk. Some threats are merely inescapable. Some we pick to accept due to the fact that to do otherwise would restrict our ability to lead our lives the way we want. And some are dangers we may choose to prevent if we had the chance to make informed options. Indoor air contamination is one danger that you can do something about.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
