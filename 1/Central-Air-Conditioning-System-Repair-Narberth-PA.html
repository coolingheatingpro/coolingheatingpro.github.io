Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
