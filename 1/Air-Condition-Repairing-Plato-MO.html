<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, many of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same duration. Essentially, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER performs in different temps. The higher the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>

Over the past century, the majority of homes in chillier climates were heated by convection, rather than radiation.

In turn, the things in the room, like furnishings and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>

<p>The homes and structure of the soil in an area can affect the rate at which heat is performed through the ground.

<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
