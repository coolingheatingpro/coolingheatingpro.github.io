<p>Professional heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually fail. HVAC experts advise following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
