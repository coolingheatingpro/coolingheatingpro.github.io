The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

<p>Start by checking out the installation manual and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. A lot of systems come with a package that includes adjustable window extensions and metal installing brackets. These parts will make sure an airtight and safe and secure fit in the window opening.
