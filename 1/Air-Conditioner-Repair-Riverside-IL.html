<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, much of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
