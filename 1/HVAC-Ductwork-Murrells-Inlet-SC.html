<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the go to. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really delighted they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Heating is also one of the most significant energy consumers in your house, so house owners who may be shopping for a brand-new furnace should considering changing it with a more recent, more energy-efficient design to conserve money and assist the environment.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling residents.
