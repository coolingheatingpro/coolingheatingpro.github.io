<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.
