<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered with a Ellenwood GA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
