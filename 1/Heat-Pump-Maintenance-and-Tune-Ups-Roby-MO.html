<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
