<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly treat and solidify-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-lived indoor air quality issue is created simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complex problems-- determined by regularly inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods listed below may be appropriate.<p>
