<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Woodland Hills CA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely efficient, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a consistent temperature. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only attain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
