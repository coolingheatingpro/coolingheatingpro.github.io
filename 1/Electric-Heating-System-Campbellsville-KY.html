<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure truth that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is simply as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often develop in ductwork, restricting air flow.

When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to worry about a thing.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
