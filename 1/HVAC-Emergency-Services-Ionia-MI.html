<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside.
