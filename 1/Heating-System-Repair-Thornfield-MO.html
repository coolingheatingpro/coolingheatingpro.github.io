<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
