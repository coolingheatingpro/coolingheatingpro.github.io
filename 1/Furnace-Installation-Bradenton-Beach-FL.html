<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
