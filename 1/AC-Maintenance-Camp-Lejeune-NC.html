<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
