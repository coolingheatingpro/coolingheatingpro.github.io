<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Need to Know in Palmdale CA</h3>
<p>After residing in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I went ahead and bought this Provider and I should say it gets the job done rather well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool off your home which is among the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had before. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by licensed HVAC technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many people.<p>
