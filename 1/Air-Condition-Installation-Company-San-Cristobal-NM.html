<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
