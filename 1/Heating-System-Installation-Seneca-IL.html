<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
