<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and overheat down. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Switch off the power.
