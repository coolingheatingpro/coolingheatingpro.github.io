<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Vital Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can imply substantial savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The first ac system and refrigerators utilized toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
