<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types.

Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems.

Radiant heat systems can likewise heat rooms with less energy invested, and keep them heated for longer, considering that most floorings tend to keep heat better than air does.<p>
