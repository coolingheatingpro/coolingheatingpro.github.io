<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's probably your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next step is to thaw your a/c devices. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
