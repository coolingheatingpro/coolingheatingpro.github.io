<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Saint Peters MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow.

In many cases, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
