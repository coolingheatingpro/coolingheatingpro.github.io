<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for many years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs unexpectedly appear greater than regular, it is most likely time to consider a new system.

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
