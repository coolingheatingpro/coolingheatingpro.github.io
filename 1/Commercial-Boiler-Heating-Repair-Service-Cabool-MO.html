<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively.

Work environment temperatures should be maintained between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air flow need to be prevented.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
