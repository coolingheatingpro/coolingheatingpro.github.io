Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if required, upgrade the structure envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>

<p>Homeowners might likewise presume that due to the fact that a glowing floor heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a home improvement, its installation will immediately raise their home's value. No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or negatively affects residential or commercial property worths.
