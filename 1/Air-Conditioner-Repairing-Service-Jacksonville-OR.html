<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to commercial or outside settings.

<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Jacksonville OR?</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning unit moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
