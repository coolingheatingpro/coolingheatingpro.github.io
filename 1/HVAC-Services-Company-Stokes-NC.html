In other cases, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends on private level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins too.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce pollutants.)
