<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat.
