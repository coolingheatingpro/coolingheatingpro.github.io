<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was type of unusual being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
