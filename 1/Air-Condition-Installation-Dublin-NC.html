<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
