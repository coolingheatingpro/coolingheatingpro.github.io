A standard a/c transfers heat out of the room since its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, considering that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
