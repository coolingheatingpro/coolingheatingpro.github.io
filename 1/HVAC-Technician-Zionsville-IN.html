<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
