<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Often a momentary indoor air quality issue is produced merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan.
