<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, particularly if you live in an area that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air. They are accountable for keeping the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned and replaced routinely.
