<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of toxin exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This enables products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at house over the weekend. Area control includes moving the contaminant source away from residents and even relocating susceptible residents.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality professionals can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To lower toxins, we advise installing advanced air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are developed to remove the smallest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sanitation systems likewise help control bacteria and natural smells. Most store-bought filters can not get rid of these smallest of irritants and do not remove bacteria and gases.<p>
