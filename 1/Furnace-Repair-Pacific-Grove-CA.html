<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
