When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room.

PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While room cooling provides optimum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
