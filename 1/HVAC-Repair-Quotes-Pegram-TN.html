<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material in time.

Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
