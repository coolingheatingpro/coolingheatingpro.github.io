<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Switch off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2).

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time.

I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent opportunity; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
