Throughout usage, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating system to the living space.<p>

If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be? Too big and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning system and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c unit will not be able to cool the house appropriately. When going shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the factors that you need to take into account.
