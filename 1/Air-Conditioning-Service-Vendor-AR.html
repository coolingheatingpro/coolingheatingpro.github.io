<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
