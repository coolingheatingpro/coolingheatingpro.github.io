<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
