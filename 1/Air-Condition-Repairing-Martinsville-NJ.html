<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
