<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they diagnosed the issue and fixed extremely rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my needs completely by providing an expert quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those processes include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
