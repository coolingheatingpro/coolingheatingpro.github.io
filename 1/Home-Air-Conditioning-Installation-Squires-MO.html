<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.

Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
