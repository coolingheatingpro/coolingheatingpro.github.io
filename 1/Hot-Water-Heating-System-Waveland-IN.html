Not just was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
