<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A/c producers typically make rugged, high quality items. Start by examining any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the unit cool off for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>

<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists utilized different methodologies. The CMHC research study called on numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they were part of a study, and the scientists did not manage for time invested or approaches used. The EPA research study prescribed and controlled approaches used on a smaller number of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have flaws, no other research study has challenged the findings. And although the devices and techniques utilized by duct-cleaning companies have changed because these research studies were performed, the air ducts in houses have not.<p>
<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales guy concerns your house he exists to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your requirements and you choose if you require it.<p>
