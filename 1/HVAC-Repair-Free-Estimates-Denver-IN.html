We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>A SEER score stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same duration. Basically, SEER offers more information based on how the EER carries out in different temps. The higher the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
