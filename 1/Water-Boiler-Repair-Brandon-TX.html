<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
