For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.  an extremely beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
