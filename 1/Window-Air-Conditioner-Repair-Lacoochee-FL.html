An alternative to packaged systems is making use of separate indoor and outdoor coils in split systems Split systems are chosen and extensively used around the world other than in The United States and Canada. In The United States and Canada, split systems are most often seen in residential applications, however they are acquiring popularity in little commercial structures. The split systems are an excellent choice for small buildings where ductwork is not practical or where the area conditioning performance is of prime concern. 19 The benefits of ductless air conditioning systems consist of easy installation, no ductwork, greater zonal control, versatility of control and peaceful operation. citation required In space conditioning, the duct losses can represent 30% of energy intake. 20 Making use of minisplit can result in energy savings in space conditioning as there are no losses associated with ducting.<p>
