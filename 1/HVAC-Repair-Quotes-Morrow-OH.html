<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
