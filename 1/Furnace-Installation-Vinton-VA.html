<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial structures, apartment and very large homes. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago remain operable, due to the fact that the lack of moving parts makes them less susceptible to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>

<p>In more complex plans, warm air is permitted to stream and rise out high building openings to the outdoors (stack result ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation plans can use very little energy, but care should be required to ensure convenience. In damp or warm environments, maintaining thermal comfort solely via natural ventilation may not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers likewise use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>
