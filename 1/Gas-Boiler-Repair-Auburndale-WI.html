<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
