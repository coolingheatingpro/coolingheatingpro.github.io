The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside system.

<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a big merchant who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that regularly monitors energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save money on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the stores fluctuate beyond an acceptable variety that might avoid consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
