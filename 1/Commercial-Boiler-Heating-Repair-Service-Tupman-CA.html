<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't warm up.

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
