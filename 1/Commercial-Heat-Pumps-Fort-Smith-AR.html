<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a basic air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the very same air course. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, because all components of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
