This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
