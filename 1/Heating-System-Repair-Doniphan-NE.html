<p>While radon in water is not an issue in houses served by most public water supplies, it has actually been found in well water. If you have actually checked the air in your house and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, call a laboratory accredited to measure radiation in water to have your water evaluated.

<p>We take a look at hints before we offer guidance to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>Usually the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more affordable method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold development and must be disposed of. Sometimes there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in concealed or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
