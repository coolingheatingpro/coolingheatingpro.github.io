You can usually conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the possibilities are good that this might work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's finest to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might grovel twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed just a few years ago.<p>
