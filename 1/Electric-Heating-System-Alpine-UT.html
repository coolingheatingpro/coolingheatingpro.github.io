We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work.

No additional charge.<p>
