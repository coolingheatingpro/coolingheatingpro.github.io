<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Among the main factors a furnace will run constantly is since something is clogged or dirty Before trying to repair any issue, take time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan".

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
