<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Bozeman MT</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
