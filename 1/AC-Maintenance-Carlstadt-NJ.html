<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
