<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
