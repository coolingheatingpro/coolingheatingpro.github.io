<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in describing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn offered great customer support at the end of the appointment by explaining exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance jobs we might want to have actually performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques utilized by some in the market.<p>
<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters clogged with dust, animal hair and other particles cause issues like failure to provide sufficient heat, excess noise and the furnace running all the time.

If the technician pertains to your home, that might be a really pricey dirty-filter diagnosis.
