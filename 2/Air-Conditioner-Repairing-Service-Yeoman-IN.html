<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an airborne product of a biological impurity. Biological contaminants in the home might include mold, germs, infections, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols released into the air can be distributed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can trigger infectious diseases such as Legionnaires' illness.

<p>A customized ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioner because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air course. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
