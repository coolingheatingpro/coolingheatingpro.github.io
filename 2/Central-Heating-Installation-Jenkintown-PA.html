<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

And mortar manufacturers may decline warranty protection if you do not follow their guidelines.<p>
