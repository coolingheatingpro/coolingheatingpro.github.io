<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may observe undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
