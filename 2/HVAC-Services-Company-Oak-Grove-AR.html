<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a referral later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor.

<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year.
