<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

Not just will blocked vents and registers impact your comfort, they can likewise lead to duct leaks due to extreme air pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused spaces is NOT a good idea. You will not save any additional money and will wind up causing more problems for your heater.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants set off allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Infectious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxins. Signs of health problems triggered by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and digestive problems.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
