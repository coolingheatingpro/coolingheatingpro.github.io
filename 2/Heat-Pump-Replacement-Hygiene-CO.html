<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil change in your car. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working. The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning devices if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing. The easiest method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
