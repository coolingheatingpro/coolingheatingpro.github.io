<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website.

I myself was also in the service call company many years earlier and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.
