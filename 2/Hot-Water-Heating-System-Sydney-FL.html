<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Sydney FL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Both must be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
