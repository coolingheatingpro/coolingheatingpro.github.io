<h3>AC Compressor in Lawrenceburg TN</h3>
<p>As noted, incorrect temperature level and humidity levels, and too little or excessive air circulation may also contribute to employee health grievances. Temperature levels should vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by excessive air blood circulation need to be prevented. Maintenance of correct temperatures and humidity levels and correct air circulation will help to reduce the incident of upper breathing signs, and, possibly, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Since it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you know it remains in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers mild effects that are typically incorrect for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, nausea, disorientation and tiredness. The impacts of CO exposure can differ significantly from individual to individual depending on age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
