<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service strategy which generally consists of a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Changing your old furnace with a new, more effective design can combat unstable energy prices, lowering your heating expenses by as much as 45%. Developments in heating technology have actually resulted in systems that contaminate less, improve convenience, and last longer. A twenty to thirty year old furnace generally has an AFUE of about 65%. The most affordable efficiency permitted by law for brand-new gas models is 78%, and there are various options that achieve 98%, for near total performance.<p>
