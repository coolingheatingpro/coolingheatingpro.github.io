<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Because an unit is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
