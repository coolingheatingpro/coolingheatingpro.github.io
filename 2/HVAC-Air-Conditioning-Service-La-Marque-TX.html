While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be required to lessen contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, residents should be alert to the emergence of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization measures should not be undertaken until these issues have actually been fixed.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have numerous control boards. The largest, or just one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard.

Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control panel must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
