<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
