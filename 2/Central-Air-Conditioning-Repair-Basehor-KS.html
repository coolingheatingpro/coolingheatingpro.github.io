<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become obstructed with particles that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Unclean filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can typically be carried out in simply a few minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
