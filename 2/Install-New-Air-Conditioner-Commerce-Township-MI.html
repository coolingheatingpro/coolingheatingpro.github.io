<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside ought to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
