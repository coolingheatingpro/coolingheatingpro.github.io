<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Seven Mile OH</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>First, understand that a bulk of your central air and system cost will come from the unit itself. AC unit costs start at $2,000 and can in fact surpass $10,000 for bigger homes. As you saw recently, you need an appropriately-sized system for your house. Otherwise, the AC will break down faster than anticipated or your month-to-month energy expenses will escalate. Therefore, you don't have overall control as to your AC unit product costs.<p>
