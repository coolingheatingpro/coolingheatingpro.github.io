<h3>Truth About Oakville CA Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
