<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
