They weren't cheap however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heater.

The controls will require the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>
