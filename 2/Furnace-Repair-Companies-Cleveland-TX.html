<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>

At the same time, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
