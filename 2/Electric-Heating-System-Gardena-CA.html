The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
