<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, however to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
