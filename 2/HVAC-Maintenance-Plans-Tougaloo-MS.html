<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
