<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, since it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outside air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
