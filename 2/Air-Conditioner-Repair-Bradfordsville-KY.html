<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house.
