The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this type in the backyards of homes. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the house. However, there are some internal components as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple rooms at once, but are not extremely energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the home. At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may spend more money on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy performance.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
