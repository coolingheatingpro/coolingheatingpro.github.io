<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
