<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor begins but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is most likely shot. Turn off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Stroh IN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>Watch out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold development and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in concealed or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, possibilities are there will be mold growing close by. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
