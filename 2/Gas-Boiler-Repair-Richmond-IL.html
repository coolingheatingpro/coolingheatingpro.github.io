<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two significant components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice prior to work began.
