On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having solved the issue with a simple repair he did on-site, not changing the entire part.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
