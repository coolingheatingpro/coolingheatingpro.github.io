Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the greater temperatures sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors.
