<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather.

The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
