<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your car. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
