<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.

<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Grand Rapids MI</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning unit and heat pump must be without all obstructions and particles. Obstructions can obstruct the flow of condensed water and cause moisture build-up within the system. Excess wetness can cause problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, uneven temperature regulation, germs, and compromised air quality. An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to make sure all excess moisture flows far from the system.<p>

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely extensive in discussing what services would be performed.

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
