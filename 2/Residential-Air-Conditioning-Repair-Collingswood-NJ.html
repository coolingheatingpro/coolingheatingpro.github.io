<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
