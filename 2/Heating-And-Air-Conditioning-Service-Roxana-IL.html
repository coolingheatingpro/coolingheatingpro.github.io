<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
