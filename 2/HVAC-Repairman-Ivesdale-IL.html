<p>If you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your house, intend on spending numerous thousand dollars for the complete system.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
