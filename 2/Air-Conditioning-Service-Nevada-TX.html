<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
