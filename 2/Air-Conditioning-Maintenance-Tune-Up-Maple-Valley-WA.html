<p>Central air units are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have been effectively dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
