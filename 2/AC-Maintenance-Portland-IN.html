<h3>Air Condition Repairing in Portland Indiana</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan ought to spin.

Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. , if it does not, you have actually offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
