<p>The first ac system and refrigerators utilized combustible or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
