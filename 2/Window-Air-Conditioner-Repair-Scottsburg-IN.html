<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
