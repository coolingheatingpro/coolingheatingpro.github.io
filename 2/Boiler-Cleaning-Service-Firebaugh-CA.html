The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
