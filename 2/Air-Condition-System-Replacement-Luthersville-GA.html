Since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
