<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in location. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is typically hard to measure, as one action specified the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repeated use of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.  a really useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
