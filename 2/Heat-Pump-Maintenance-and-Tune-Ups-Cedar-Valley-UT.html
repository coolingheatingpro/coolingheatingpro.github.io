<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a home heating unit, you may look for a heatpump more tailored toward cooling capability and performance. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
