<p>Radiant heating systems don't utilize ducts, which makes them a fair bit more energy efficient than other systems. They also don't produce cold and hot spots. All of the heat that radiant heat systems distribute moves through solid objects, keeping the heat near the floor of the space where it is the most use. Radiant heat systems can also heat spaces with less energy invested, and keep them heated for longer, because many floorings tend to maintain heat much better than air does.<p>
