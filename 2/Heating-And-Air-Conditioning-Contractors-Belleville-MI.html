The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
