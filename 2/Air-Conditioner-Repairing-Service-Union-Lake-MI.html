<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, brand-new installation practices are lowering expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>
