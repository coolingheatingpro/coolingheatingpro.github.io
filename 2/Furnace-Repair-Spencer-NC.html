<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
