<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
