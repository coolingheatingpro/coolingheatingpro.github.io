Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
