<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
