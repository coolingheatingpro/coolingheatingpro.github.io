<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the increase it requires from the capacitor. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are good that this might work for one cycle, however the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>For contaminants other than radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health signs or signs of bad ventilation and specific sources or contaminants have actually been identified as possible reasons for indoor air quality issues.
