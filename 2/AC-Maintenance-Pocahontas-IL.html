<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your air conditioning system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Simply including refrigerant is not a service if it leakages. A trained technician must fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and performance of your a/c is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the producer's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
