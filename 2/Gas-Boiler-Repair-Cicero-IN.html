<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Cicero IN</h3>
<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate.

<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Cicero IN</h3>
<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.) In addition, residents should be alert to the introduction of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization steps must not be undertaken until these problems have been remedied.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the home. Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering the house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care items. Germs and infections, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
