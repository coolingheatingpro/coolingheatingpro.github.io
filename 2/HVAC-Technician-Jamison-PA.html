<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils.

It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>For example, pollutants may collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
