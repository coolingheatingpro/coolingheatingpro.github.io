<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
