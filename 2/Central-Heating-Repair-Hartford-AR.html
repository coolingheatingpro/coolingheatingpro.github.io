<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a straightforward and effective  technique to minimize ambient air pollution and potential health threats, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
