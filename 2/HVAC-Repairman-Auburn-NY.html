<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing. If temperature levels drop and reach listed below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which immediately shut down the heat pump. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
