<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
