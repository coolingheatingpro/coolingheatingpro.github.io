<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
