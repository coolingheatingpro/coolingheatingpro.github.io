<p>The purpose of many building ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at reasonable energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video alone. Just like determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of unit for your home likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
