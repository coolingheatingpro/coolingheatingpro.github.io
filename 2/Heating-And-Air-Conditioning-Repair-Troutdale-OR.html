<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price great however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
