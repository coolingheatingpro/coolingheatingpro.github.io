<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>HVAC Technician in Richland SC</h3>
<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A great place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one component (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is usually higher than lots of heat pump alternatives, they can still be extremely effective, depending on the design you buy.

This suggests it can warm up your home to the wanted temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
