<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00.

<p>Both need to be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to routinely clean up the condenser coil.
