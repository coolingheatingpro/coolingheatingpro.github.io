<p>We called Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to evaluate circumstance & chose to opt for them for the work.

<p>Though it may be difficult to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are many other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products contribute to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unstable organic substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpets and upholstery materials can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
