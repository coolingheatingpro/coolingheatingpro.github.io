<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also intensify indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be contaminated (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread these toxins throughout the home.

<h3>House Ventilation in Elko New Market Minnesota</h3>
<p>The truth is, air pollution in your house can be just as bad - or even worse - than it is outdoors. And with the average American spending 87% of their life inside, you 'd think that indoor air quality would be something we 'd become aware of more often. But do not panic! With a little preventative maintenance and some standard knowledge, you can take immediate steps to improve your indoor air quality today.<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture inside is related to a higher occurrence of occupant respiratory problems.<p>
<p>We have been exceptionally pleased with Stability's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has worked very well and is so efficient that it substantially lowered our utility costs - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we have needed them for emergency situations they responded quickly and resolved the problem.<p>
