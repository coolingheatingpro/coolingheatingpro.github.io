The most effective fans are durable and quiet. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors.

That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
