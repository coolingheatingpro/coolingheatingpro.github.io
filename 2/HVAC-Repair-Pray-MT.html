<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Plenty of HVAC companies will evaluate things like specialized filter modifications throughout Preventative Maintenance gos to, individually, as an include on service for you. No 2 systems are precisely the exact same, but filter changes are something we provide throughout PM check outs if the customer needs it- specifically the inaccessible filters- since we understand how crucial it is that they be changed out & how hard it can be for a homeowner to do it.<p>

During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
