<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
