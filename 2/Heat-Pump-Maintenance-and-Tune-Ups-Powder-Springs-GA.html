<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very happy that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit prior to you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
