Inadequate ventilation also takes place if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or placed in such a method that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Poorly situated outside air consumption vents can also bring in air infected with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in houses can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, including contaminated soil tracked within, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works however your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
