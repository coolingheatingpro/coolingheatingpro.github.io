<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c into a heat pump While room air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
