<p>You might update to the highest efficiency gear readily available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The typical house's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower systems, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air gets away the system.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you each time they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was six months before the existing one expired. She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
