<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to provide enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
