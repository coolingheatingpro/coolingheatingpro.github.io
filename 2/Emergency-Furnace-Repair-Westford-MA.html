<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can imply substantial cost savings in annual heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>

<h3>Electric Heating in Westford Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This allows products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at home over the weekend. Area control involves moving the contaminant source far from occupants or perhaps relocating vulnerable occupants.<p>
<p>Speaking of air, radiant heat systems tend to enhance indoor air quality. This is because forced air heating systems flow airborne pollutants throughout the home during operation, provoking a range of different unfavorable impacts. Radiant heat systems don't circulate air at all, which in fact enhances your indoor air quality by limiting your direct exposure to high levels of airborne contaminants.<p>
