Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside your home might trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
