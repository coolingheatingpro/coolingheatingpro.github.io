<p>A specific air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air course. Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>
