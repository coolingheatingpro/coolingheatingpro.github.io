<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx customers don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working. American Standard a/c are one of the best central air conditioning brands in the business. The typical cost to install a 14 SEER American Standard AC system would be around $2,600 to $3,200. The company gets far fewer repair calls for its' AC systems than the majority of the other AC units in the business. You can feel good about paying a premium for this AC unit, because you'll be getting a whole lot of worth with the purchase.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
