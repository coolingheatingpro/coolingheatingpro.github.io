<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne.
