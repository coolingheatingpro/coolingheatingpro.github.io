<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs unexpectedly appear greater than normal, it is most likely time to consider a brand-new system. New heating equipment is far more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to mention the money you'll save on repair expenses. If your heating system is 25 years old or more, you can probably anticipate to cut your fuel expenses in half.<p>
<p>Increasing energy expenses are not the only reason for high costs. Heating systems frequently lose their performance as they age, especially if they have actually not been effectively maintained.

And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies each month might be used to help you pay for a brand-new, far more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace.

<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Orange VA</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being much more extreme with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are frequently installed in tandem with a more conventional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heat pump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
