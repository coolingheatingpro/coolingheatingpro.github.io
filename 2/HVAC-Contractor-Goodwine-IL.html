<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for property owners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just available for larger houses due to their high power and capability.

Therefore, this may not be the best alternative for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
