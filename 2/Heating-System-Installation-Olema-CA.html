The result, therefore, is totally free warm water! Furthermore, during winter season, the heat from underground can be taken in to heat domestic water alongside its main purpose of providing space heating. This suggests that cost savings are still recognized during the cooler period. In reality, a desuperheater decreases winter water heating expenses by around half.<p>
