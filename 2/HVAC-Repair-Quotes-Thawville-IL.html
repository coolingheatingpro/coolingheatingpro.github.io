This was originally driven by increasing energy costs, and has more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological issues. Furthermore, improvements to the HVAC system efficiency can also help increase occupant health and performance. 21 In the US, the EPA has actually enforced tighter constraints over the years. There are numerous methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>

A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in price from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation. Geothermal heatpump generally need excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
