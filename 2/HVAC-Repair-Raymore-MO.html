<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Raymore MO</h3>
<p>In homes, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pushed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard consists of a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
