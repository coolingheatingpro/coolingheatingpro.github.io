<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in gathering information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>In some cases a temporary indoor air quality problem is produced merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complex issues-- determined by regularly inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, one of the three techniques listed below might be proper.<p>
