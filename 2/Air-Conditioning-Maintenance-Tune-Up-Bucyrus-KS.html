<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any air flow constraint will reduce the unit's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>

<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to effectively cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
