<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Installation in Bentonia Mississippi</h3>
<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is probably frozen. Also, if the ac system smells bad, there could be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil absorbs the heat away from your home. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning system's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Since these activities produce big amounts of lead dust, people have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint.
