<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
