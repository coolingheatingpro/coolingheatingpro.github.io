<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the compressor, condenser, and evaporator are all situated in one cabinet, which normally is put on a roofing or on a concrete piece next to your house's structure. This type of air conditioning unit also is utilized in little commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts originate from indoors through the house's exterior wall or roof to connect with the packaged a/c unit, which is generally situated outdoors. Packaged ac system typically consist of electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This combination of air conditioning unit and central heating unit gets rid of the requirement for a separate furnace inside your home.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
