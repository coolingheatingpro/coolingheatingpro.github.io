Part of keeping your furnace includes checking the suggested connections as well as temperature and pressure evaluates. Take some time to check these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and secure.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>
