Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan need to spin.

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Huntly VA</h3>
<p>Pricing for furnace service and maintenance will vary widely from dealer to dealership, for a number of factors. Some dealerships will be supply a more extensive service with stated performance guarantees, while others may do a more standard service at a special rate to create brand-new service. Both approaches can yield the desired result of keeping your furnace heating unit performing well as long as the service is offered by a trusted HVAC contractor. A Carrier ® furnace dealership can quickly and quickly give you a quote for heating system service and get you set up for your yearly maintenance.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
