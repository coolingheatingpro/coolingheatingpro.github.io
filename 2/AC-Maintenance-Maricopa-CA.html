<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
