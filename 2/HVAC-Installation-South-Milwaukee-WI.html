<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
