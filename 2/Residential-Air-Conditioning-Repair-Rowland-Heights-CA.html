<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
