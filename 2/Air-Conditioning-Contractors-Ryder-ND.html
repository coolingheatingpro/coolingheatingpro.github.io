<p>You could upgrade to the greatest performance equipment readily available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are just part of the central air conditioning system. The average house's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air gets away the system.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a referral later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
