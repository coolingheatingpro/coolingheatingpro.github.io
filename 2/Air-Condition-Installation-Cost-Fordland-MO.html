<h3>Electric Boiler Repair in Fordland MO</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
