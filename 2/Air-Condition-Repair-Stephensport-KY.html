<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
