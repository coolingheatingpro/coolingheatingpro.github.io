<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being airborne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, however not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
