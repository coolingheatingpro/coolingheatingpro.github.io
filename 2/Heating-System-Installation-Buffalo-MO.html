<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal.

What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
