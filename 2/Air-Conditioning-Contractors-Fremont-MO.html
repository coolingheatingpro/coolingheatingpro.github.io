<p>The exhaust outlets permit all dangerous gases to leave your property so there's no risky accumulation of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. They can lead to a dangerous accumulation and jeopardize your security if the exhaust outlets are obstructed.

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years back and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you have to do it often, it's most likely time for a professional viewpoint.<p>
