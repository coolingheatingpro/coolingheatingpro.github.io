<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. Once the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms.
