<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to supply enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
