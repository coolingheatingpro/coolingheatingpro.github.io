<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>
