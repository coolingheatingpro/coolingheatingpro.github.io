<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Brooklyn IN</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require reasonably little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater resemble those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be looked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water areas). The systems need to be inspected at least two times annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector performance.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
