<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to also be required to decrease contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners need to be alert to the development of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures must not be carried out up until these issues have been remedied.<p>
<p>A property owner can successfully learn to do a task such as bleeding and rebooting an oil furnace, but you need to be positive that you know what you're doing. People who are experienced with such do-it-yourself projects will most likely be able to bleed the furnace without excessive of an issue. Individuals who seldom do this kind of work around your house must let an expert handle it You can constantly discover if you want to, however going at it alone the very first time isn't a good idea if you don't understand what's going on.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heating system, you might try to find a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
