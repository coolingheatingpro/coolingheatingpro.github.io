Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
