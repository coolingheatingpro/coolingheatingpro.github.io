<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>There are lots of actions a property owner can take to select items that will prevent indoor air problems from taking place - a couple of them are pointed out here.

Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
