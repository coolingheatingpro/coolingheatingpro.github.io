<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Willow Creek MT</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit".

The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
