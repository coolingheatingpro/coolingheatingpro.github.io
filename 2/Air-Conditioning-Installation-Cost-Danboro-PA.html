<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
