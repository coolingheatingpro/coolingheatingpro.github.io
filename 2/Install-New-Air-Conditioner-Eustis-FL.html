<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
