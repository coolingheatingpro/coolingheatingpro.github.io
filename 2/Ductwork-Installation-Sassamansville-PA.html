<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Sassamansville PA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
