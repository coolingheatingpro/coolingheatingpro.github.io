Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions due to the fact that they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
