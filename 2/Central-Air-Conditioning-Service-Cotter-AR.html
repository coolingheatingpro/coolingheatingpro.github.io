<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
