<p>Place the solar tank near the standard water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is likely that it is supported by the pipes. Set up unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
<h3>Home Air Conditioning Installation in Saddle Brook New Jersey</h3>

<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales guy pertains to your home he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and must not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.
