<p>The possibility of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%.
