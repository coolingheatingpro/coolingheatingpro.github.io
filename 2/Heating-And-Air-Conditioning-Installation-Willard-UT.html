<p>Sean was very valuable. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
