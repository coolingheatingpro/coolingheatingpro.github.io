<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, ceiling, and flooring coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold growth and need to be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in concealed or hardly ever accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
