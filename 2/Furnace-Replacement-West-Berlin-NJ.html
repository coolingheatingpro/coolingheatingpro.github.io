<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines set up under the flooring or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the service technicians thought they simply didn't seem ideal and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
