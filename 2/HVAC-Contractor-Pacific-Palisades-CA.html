<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Pacific Palisades CA</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
