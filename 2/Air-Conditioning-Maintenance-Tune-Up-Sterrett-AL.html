<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
