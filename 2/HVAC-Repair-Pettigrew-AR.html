<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
