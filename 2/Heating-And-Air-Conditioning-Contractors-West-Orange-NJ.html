<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in houses can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, consisting of polluted soil tracked within, and usage of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>There are numerous non-profit companies that certify indoor air quality specialists. Although DEP can not suggest the services of any particular individual or company, picking a professional that has received the appropriate training and accreditation need to help ensure you get quality services. When selecting an indoor air quality professional, it is necessary to compare the services (and rates) of different professionals, inspect recommendations, etc. just as you would for any other product and services.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly.
