<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is developed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure products, cigarette smoking, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in manufactured products.

<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They consist of delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, kids, and infants are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the harmful results of lead. Kids might have greater exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
