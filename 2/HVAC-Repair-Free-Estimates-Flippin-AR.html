<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years ago and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heater seems less like a luxury product and more like a requirement. (Besides, warmed floorings were great enough for the Roman Empire) But before you dedicate to what can be a significant renovation project, it's best to ask yourself whether a glowing flooring heater is an appropriate option for your particular house heating needs.<p>
