<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. Once the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly harden and treat-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
