<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your automobile. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter when every three months. Throughout high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more tough to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is often crucial to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking information from the employer. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might recognize potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are really low, keeping track of data may not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
