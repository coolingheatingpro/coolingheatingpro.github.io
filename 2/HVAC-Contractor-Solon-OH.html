And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>There are numerous actions a homeowner can require to select products that will prevent indoor air problems from occurring - a couple of them are mentioned here. Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, think about using strong wood items. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>
