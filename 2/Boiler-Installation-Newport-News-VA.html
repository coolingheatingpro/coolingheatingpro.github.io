<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
