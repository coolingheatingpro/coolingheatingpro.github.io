<h3>Heat Pump Cost in Hartland WI</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my services, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, reliable, and affordable on rate. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they detected the problem and repaired really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
