<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and harden-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
