<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
