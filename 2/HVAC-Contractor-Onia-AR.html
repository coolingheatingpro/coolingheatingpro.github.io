<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning an organisation was for monetary flexibility.

HVAC business owners must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the exact same in all other locations.<p>
