<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
