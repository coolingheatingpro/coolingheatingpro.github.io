<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the home. Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care items. Viruses and germs, animal dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
