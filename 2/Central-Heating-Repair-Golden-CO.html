Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space.

<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
