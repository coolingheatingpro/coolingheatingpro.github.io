<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for several years.

As an outcome your oil or gas furnace might run longer to supply the exact same amount of heat. This will trigger your energy expenses to go up. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies each month could be utilized to assist you pay for a brand-new, far more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a substantial distinction, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
