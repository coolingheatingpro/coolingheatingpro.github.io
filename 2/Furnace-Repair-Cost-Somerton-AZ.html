<p>Trace was the service technician that took care of my semi yearly maintenance today.

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were informative and practical, Ballard Gas provided us a better offer, for extraordinary service. Instead of a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating unit and located methods we could have more even heat.

We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of recent warmer summer seasons and for ecological factors.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down rapidly. This is a very typical repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensing unit changed as preventative maintenance since the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
