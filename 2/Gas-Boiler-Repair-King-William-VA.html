<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your air conditioning unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leaks, just adding refrigerant is not an option. A trained technician should fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and efficiency of your ac system is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can likewise be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Since it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
