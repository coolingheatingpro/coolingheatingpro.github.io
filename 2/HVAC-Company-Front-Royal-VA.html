<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
