<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than commercial or outside settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
