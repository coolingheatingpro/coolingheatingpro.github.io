<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
