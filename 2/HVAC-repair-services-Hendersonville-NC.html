<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Second of all like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the unit has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
