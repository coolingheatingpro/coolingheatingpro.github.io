<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Heating is also among the biggest energy customers in your house, so house owners who may be looking for a new furnace needs to thinking about changing it with a newer, more energy-efficient design to save money and help the environment. The typical furnace lasts between 15 and 20 years, so you're making a significant investment in your house. Spend carefully by learning as much as you can about available options.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
