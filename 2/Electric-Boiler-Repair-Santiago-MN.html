<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>As noted, incorrect temperature level and humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation may also add to worker health complaints. Temperature levels need to vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air blood circulation should be prevented. Maintenance of appropriate temperature levels and humidity levels and appropriate air circulation will help to lower the event of upper breathing signs, and, possibly, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit honest, responsive and pleasant. Jeremiah Bartula the plumber discussed our options prior to our deal with Brian and was extraordinary, useful and informative - his work was flawless! All of his assistants were courteous and diligent. The work site was left absolutely cleared and cleaned up. We would highly encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and A/c for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it pertains to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
