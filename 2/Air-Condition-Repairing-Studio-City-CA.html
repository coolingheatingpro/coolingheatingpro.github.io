<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a home heating system, you might try to find a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and performance. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new homes are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. A few of these designs include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (likewise called air-to-air heat exchangers).
