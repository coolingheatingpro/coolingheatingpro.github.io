<p>In the last a number of years, a growing body of scientific evidence has actually shown that the air within homes and other structures can be more seriously polluted than the outside air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research study suggests that individuals invest approximately 90 percent of their time indoors. Hence, for many people, the threats to health might be greater due to exposure to air contamination inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
