<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced.
