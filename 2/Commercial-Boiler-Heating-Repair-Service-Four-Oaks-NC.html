<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
