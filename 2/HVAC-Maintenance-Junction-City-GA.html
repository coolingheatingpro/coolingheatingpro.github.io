<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
