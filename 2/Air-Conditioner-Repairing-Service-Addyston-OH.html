<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
