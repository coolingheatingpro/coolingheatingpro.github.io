<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
