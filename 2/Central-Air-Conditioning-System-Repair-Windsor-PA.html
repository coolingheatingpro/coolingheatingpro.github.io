<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably simple to determine surrogate for indoor toxins released by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside your home might trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
