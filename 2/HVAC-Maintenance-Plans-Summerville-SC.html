<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Summerville SC</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually brought on by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the main problem in majority the office indoor air investigations it has carried out. Examinations carried out in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the same to be real. These examinations exposed that proper ventilation is important in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your home, however there are numerous other toxins that can not just dirty up the air, but cause other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure materials add to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (unstable natural substances) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery materials can cause issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
