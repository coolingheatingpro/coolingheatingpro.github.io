<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

At present, very little is learnt about what health results occur from the levels of organics typically discovered in homes. Many organic substances are known to cause cancer in animals; some are thought of triggering, or are known to trigger, cancer in humans.<p>
