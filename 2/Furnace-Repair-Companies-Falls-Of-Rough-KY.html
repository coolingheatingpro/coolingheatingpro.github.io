<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, a professional service person need to be called for nearly any maintenance aside from regular cleaning.

While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system operating at peak performance.<p>
