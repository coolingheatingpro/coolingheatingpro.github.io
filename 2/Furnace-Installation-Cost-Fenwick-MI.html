Instead of sending out air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thus the amount of moisture in the air might be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the room manageable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped keep constant paper measurements and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's innovation was applied to increase productivity in the work environment, and The Carrier Cooling Company of America was formed to fulfill increasing demand. In time, a/c became used to improve comfort in houses and autos too.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
