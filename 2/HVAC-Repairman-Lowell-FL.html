<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure.

The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat generated from the ground source heat pump compressor and uses it to heat water. This indicates that this device can also offer totally free hot water for domestic use in addition to its standard geothermal heating and cooling function.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they concern perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months prior to the current one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
