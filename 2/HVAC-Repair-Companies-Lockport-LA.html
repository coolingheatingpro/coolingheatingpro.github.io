<p>Radiant heating uses a variety of distinct benefits over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They don't have to stress over duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of as much as 30% in other heater types. Sending heat through strong things will also cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A home warmed by a glowing system will heat up quicker, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are simply a few of the many benefits that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
