<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
