<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system. Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service.

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more effective than room a/c unit. In addition, they are out of the way, peaceful, and practical to operate.

In an average air-conditioned house, air conditioning takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical power per year, triggering power plants to release about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
