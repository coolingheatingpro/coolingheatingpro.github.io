The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit.

Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, considering that the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into consideration not just the small power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>

Individuals also respond extremely in a different way to exposure to indoor air contaminants. Additional research is needed to much better understand which health results occur after direct exposure to the average pollutant concentrations discovered in homes and which occur from the greater concentrations that occur for brief time periods.<p>

This can lead to the capacity for significant health problems.<p>
