<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
