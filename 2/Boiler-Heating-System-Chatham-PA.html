<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can likewise arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, consisting of infected soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
