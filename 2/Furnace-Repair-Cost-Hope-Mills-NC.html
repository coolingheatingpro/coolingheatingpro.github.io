<p>A regular furnace tune up can go a long way towards minimizing a lot of the problems brought on by accumulation of dirt and particles, and the examinations enable your contractor to keep track of longer-term problems and take proactive actions to help avoid early failure or inconvenient breakdowns during the heating season. Annual furnace service may also be a requirement to keep your furnace warranty valid too. Lots of makers state on warranty paperwork that installation and maintenance by a certified HVAC service provider are a part of the service warranty conditions. When you have a ten-year parts restricted warranty as is basic on Provider Â® furnaces, you'll want to make certain you keep that protection valid for the full 10 years.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your investment by just utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a certified agent from a company or retailer to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed individual to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the cooling system. A voided guarantee will not do you any great need to the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and hire a licensed person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
