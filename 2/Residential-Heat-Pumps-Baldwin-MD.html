<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

In the process, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Over the previous couple of years, there has actually been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have been shown to minimize levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is presently no proof, however, that a reasonable variety of houseplants get rid of considerable amounts of toxins in homes and workplaces. Indoor houseplants must not be over-watered since excessively wet soil may promote the development of microorganisms which can impact allergic individuals.<p>
