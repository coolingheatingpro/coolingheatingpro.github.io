<p>Together with these weather changes, we have actually also been the country's fastest growing city over the last decade, adding well over 100,000 people, or a development of 18.7 percent according to the Seattle Times In many locations of our nation, air conditioning is a standard necessity, implying the people that move here from out of state are most likely expecting to have a/c. Likewise, housing costs in Seattle have skyrocketed, and as a result, more recent houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bedrooms on the upper levels. Numerous attics are also being converted to finished bed rooms to add extra space. Rooms in the upper locations of houses are specifically susceptible to getting unpleasant and incredibly hot throughout the summertime, making air conditioning much more essential.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
