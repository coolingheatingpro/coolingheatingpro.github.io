<p>Together with these weather changes, we have actually also been the country's fastest growing city over the last decade, adding well over 100,000 people, or a development of 18.7 percent according to the Seattle Times In many locations of our nation, air conditioning is a standard necessity, implying the people that move here from out of state are most likely expecting to have a/c. Likewise, housing costs in Seattle have skyrocketed, and as a result, more recent houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bedrooms on the upper levels.
