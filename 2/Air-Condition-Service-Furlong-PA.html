<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
