<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary ecological risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead enters the body. Before it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
