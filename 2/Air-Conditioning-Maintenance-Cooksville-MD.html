<h3>Central Heating Installation in Cooksville MD</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
