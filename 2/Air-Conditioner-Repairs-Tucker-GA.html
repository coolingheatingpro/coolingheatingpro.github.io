<p>The possibility of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends on specific level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it concerns central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air.
