<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run since it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness.
