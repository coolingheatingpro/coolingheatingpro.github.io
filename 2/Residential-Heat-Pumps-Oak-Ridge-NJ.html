<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold.

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
