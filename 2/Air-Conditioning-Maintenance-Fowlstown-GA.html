<p>Aspects that can add to the development of biological pollutants are wet or damp structure products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem triggered by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs.
