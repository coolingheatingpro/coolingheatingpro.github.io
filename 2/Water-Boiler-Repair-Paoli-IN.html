<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
