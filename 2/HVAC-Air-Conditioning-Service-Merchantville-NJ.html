<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the house.

<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your home still heats up to the ideal temperature. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. Only be concerned if your home is not heating up. However, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you ought to employ a professional to repair the unit and inspect.<p>

<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is frosty.
