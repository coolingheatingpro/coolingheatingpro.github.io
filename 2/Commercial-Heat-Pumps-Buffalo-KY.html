<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Buffalo KY</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
