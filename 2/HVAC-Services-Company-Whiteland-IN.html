<p>Heaters are appliances whose purpose is to produce heat (i.e. heat) for the building. This can be done by means of central heating Such a system includes a furnace, heat, or boiler  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central location such as a furnace space in a home, or a mechanical space in a large building.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
