<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, given that the system is integrated.
