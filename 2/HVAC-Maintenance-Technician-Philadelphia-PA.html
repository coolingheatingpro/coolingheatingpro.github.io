<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions due to the fact that they don't require any new ductwork to be set up. Because an unit is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
