<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most effective heating sources in terms of ecological costs. It protects the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or toxins due to the fact that the energy utilized to heat your home is drawn out directly from the ground. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems similar to those utilized in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical power, they release far fewer greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating systems that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>

Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
