<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4).

The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
