<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the very same in all other locations.<p>
