<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
