<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
