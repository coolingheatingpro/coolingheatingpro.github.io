<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those dimensions on hand when purchasing an a/c to ensure it'll fit easily into the window. Also, keep fire security in mind when deciding where to install the air conditioning unit: Don't place it in an egress window that acts as the only methods of escape need to a fire erupt.<p>
