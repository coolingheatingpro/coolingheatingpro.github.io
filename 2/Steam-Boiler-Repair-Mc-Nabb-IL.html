<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the tools or abilities required to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line?

Nevertheless, some manufacturers require routine maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the 2 need to not be puzzled.

The 2 operations utilize various procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its aims.<p>
