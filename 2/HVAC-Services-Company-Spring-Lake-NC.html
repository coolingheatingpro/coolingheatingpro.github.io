<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in place. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one reaction specified the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or ac system don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring usage of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  a very helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
