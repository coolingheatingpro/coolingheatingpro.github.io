<h3>Commercial Heat Pumps in Syria VA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
