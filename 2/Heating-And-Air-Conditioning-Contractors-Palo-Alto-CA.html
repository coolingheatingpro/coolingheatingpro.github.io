<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Ductwork Cleaning in Palo Alto California</h3>
<p>If your a/c is more than eight years old, repair is probably not worth the expenditure, unless it's a simple issue like debris blocking the condenser system or a used fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to evaluate not simply the condition of your existing devices, however also the ducts that provide the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those aspects might increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than installing new equipment.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a cars and truck radiator or normal home air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>
