<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
