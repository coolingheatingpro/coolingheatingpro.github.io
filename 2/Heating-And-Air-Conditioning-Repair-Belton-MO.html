<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly greater incomes for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or simply a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical wages for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
