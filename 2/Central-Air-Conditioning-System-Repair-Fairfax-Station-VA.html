<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same way as a vehicle radiator or common family a/c does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>

<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Fairfax Station VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
