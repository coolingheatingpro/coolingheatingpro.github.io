<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Ensure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.
