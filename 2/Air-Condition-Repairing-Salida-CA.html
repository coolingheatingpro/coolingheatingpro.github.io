<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Salida CA</h3>
<p>Specific instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often hard to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is important to take notice of the time and location symptoms occur. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is far from the location, for instance, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results may be worsened by an insufficient supply of outdoor air coming indoors or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions widespread inside your home.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
