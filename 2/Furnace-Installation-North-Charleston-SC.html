<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
