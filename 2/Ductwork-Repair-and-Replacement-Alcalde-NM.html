Pushed wood products produced indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is generally recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
