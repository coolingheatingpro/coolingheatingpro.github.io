<p>Many individuals underestimate the degree of the indoor air pollution issue. Air contamination is generally envisioned as the black smoke released from factories. Little thought is provided to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, paints, cleaners, and pesticides used in the home. To intensify the problem, it is approximated that the typical American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time indoors, and majority that time is spent in the house.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by numerous thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is extremely important to keeping a proper temperature level.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year.
