<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
