<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also intensify indoor air quality issues.
