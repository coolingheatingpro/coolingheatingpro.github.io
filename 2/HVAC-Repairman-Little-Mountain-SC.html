<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced.
