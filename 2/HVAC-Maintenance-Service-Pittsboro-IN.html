<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
