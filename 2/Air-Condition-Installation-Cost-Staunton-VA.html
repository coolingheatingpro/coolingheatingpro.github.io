<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The firm began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, until the required for high-efficiency systems required Goettl to end production.

<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in effectiveness advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because an unit is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
