<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Numerous typical building materials utilized before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling. Elimination of asbestos-containing products is not always optimum due to the fact that the fibers can be spread out into the air during the removal procedure. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is frequently suggested instead.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily integrated with existing systems such as standard forced air or glowing floor heating or can be installed in a new structure.

Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in tons. Usually, a 3-ton setup should suffice for the typical house, however house size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land schedule are all factors which will influence the right size for your particular home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you correctly size a system.<p>
