<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
