<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
