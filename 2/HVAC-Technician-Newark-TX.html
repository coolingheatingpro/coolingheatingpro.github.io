<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
