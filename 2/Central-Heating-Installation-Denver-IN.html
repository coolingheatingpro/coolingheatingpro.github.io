EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies further details on air-cleaning gadgets to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
