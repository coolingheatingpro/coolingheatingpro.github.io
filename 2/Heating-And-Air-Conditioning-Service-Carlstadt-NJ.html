<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A great place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it!

Managers with BPI accreditation know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as just one element (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities.

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you have to do it frequently, it's most likely time for an expert opinion.<p>
