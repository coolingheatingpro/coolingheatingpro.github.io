<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.

<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
