<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, however numerous utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a much better option.
