<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
