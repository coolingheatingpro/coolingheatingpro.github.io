Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person should be required almost any maintenance aside from routine cleaning.

Contact your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no client problems have actually been submitted and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is legitimate and active. Compare the various furnace performance scores recommended by the individual contractors to select the design and system that finest suits your energy needs.

<p>When all the jobs have actually been finished, the last task is to test the system to ensure it cools effectively. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This final check might point out faults in the thermostat, which may be as basic as a need to change batteries. A failure to switch on may just involve a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any issues or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where suitable.<p>
