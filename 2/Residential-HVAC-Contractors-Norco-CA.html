<p>The first ac system and refrigerators used hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal accidents when they dripped.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
