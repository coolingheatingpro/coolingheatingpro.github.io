(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
