For example, residential HVAC installation must be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service should be priced differently from duct cleaning. If you are offering more than one service, you must separate these into different departments, as if they were their own different organisation.<p>
<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day.
