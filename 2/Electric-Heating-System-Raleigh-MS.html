<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
