<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
