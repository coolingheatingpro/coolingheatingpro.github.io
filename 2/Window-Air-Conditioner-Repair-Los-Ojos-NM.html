<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Los Ojos NM</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the cooling. I went on and bought this Carrier and I should say it does the job quite well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool off your house which is among the things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had before. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was needed and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater because the technicians believed they simply didn't seem right and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
