<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.

What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
