<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Mc Daniels KY</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
