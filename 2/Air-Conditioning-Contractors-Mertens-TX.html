<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Installation in Mertens Texas</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Some illness, like humidifier fever, are associated with direct exposure to toxic substances from microorganisms that can grow in big structure ventilation systems. Nevertheless, these illness can also be traced to bacteria that grow in house heating and cooling systems and humidifiers.

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing material bought with the house. This company presented a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the inspection on a really cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health danger reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new property owner I have discovered how to recognize the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
