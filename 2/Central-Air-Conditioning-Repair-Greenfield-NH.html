<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
