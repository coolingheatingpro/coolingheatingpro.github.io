The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
