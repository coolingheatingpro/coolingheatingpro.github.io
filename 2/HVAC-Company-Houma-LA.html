<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by many public water products, it has actually been discovered in well water. If you've evaluated the air in your house and found a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a lab licensed to determine radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon problems in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>The predominant health effect associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
