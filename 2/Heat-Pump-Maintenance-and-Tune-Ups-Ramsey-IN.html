<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the concern and repaired very rapidly.
