<p>We look at hints prior to we provide advice to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently.

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
