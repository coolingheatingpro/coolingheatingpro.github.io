<h3>Residential Heat Pumps in Independence MO</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year.

Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they identified the concern and repaired very rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
