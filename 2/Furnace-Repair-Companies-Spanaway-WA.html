<h3>How To Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Spanaway WA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure.

We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater.
