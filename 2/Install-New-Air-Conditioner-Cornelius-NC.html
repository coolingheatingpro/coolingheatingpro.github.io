<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

In selecting a furnace, property owners need to consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
