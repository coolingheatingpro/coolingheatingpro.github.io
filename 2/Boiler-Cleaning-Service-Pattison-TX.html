<p>I typically don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
