<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. For that reason, a professional service person ought to be required almost any maintenance aside from regular cleaning.

While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system operating at peak efficiency.<p>
