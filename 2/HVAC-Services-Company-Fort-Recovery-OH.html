<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
