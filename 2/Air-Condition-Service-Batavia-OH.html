<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any air flow limitation will lower the system's effectiveness. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Utilize experts and treat them well: Motivated, well-compensated experts carry out better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.
