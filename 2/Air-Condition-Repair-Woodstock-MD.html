<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
