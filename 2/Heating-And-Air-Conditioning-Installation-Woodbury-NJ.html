<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary ecological danger to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead enters the body. Before it was known how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
