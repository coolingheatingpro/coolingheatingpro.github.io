When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
