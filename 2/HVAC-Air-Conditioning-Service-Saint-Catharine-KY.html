<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions need to also be required to reduce contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.)

Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
