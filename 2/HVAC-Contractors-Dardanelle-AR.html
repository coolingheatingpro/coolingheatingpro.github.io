<p>Though it might be tough to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are many other toxins that can not just dirty up the air, but result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure materials contribute to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unstable natural compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Lots of AC systems include a number of special functions that can further improve efficiency and performance. For example, property owners may wish to try to find one that features a built-in filter light that will notify you when the air filter needs to be altered. Another popular function to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to decrease energy expenses a lot more. Of course, more features suggest higher central air expenses.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
