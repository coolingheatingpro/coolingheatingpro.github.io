<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works however your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
