We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same contaminants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
