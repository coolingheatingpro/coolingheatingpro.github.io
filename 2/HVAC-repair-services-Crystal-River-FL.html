<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
