<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.

The absence of moving parts implies you're less likely to spend big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're significantly more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
