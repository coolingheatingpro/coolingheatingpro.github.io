<h3>The Way to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Labelle FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
