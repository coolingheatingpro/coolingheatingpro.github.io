<h3>Electric Furnace in Penn Laird VA</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
