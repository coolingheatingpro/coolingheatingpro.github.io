<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most affordable. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher airflow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and new air filtration innovations are ending up being more common as offered options in commercial and residential HVAC item bundles. Adoption of these innovations, nevertheless, has actually not been widespread, as customers remain mainly unconcerned to the results of air quality on health and productivity.<p>
