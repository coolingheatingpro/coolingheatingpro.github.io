<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
