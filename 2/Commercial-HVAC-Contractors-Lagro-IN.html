<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
