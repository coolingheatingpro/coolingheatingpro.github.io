<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Concord VA</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on rate. It's tough to discover an honest AC person and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
