<h3>Is Your Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Upham ND?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
