<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a really enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor.

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in gathering info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day.

The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
