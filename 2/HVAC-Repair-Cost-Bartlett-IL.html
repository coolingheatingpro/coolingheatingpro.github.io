<p>Info provided in this safety guide is based upon present scientific and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Structures continuously develop as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them in addition to the residents, materials, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a structure are continuously interacting, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For instance, we may see a window as changing slightly with time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see may be progressing as an outcome of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>
<p>If you work in building, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your pastime involves lead, you might unwittingly bring lead into your home on your clothing or hands. You might also be tracking in lead from soil around your home. Soil really near houses may be polluted from lead paint on the outside of the building. Soil by roads and highways may be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Usage door mats to wipe your feet before getting in the house. Change your clothing before you go home and wash these clothing separately if you work with lead in your task or a pastime. Encourage your kids to play in sand and grassy areas rather of dirt which adheres to fingers and toys. Try to keep your children from eating dirt, and make certain they wash their hands when they come inside.<p>
