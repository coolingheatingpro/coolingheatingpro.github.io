<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the tools or abilities necessary to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the needed equipment for the job. The bottom line?

While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
