<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years ago and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. When they are managed in a way that produces dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these items present a danger only. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or interrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if proper controls are not in location. This can result in the potential for substantial illness.<p>
