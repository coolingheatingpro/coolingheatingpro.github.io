<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but numerous use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a much better option. If the current system has actually not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be determined and treated, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
