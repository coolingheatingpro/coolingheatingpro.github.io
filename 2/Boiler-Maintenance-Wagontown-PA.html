<h3>AC Duct Replacement in Wagontown Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
