For example, he might seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more reliable service to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
