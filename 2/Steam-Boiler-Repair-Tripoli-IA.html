<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might flatter twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a few years back.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
