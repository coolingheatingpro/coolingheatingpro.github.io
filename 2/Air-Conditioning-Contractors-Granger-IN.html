<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Granger IN</h3>
<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these devices is uncertain since they just partially remove the radon decay products and do not lessen the quantity of radon entering the home. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a reputable ways of decreasing the health danger from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies additional info on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are usually not really efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not attain a performance greater than 90%. A few high-end brands have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more expensive, having beginning expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Since a drain requires to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more affordable method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses.

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
