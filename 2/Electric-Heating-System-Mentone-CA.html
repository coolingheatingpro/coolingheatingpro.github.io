Lots of typical structure products utilized before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials.

A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is often recommended instead.<p>
