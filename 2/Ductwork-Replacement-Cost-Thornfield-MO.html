<h3>Residential Heat Pumps in Thornfield MO</h3>
<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good location to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI accreditation understand that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as just one component (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
