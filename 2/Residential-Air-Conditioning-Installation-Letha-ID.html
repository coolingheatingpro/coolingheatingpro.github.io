<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils.

It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
