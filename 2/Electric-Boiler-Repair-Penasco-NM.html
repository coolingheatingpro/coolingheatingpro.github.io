<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
