<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
