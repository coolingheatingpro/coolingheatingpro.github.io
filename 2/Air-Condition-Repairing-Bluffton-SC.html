<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may observe moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy.

Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
