Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently difficult to quantify, as one action mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of recurring use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.  a very useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
