<h3>AC Replacement Service in South Houston TX</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any air flow limitation will reduce the system's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Though it might be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your home, however there are many other toxins that can not only unclean up the air, but lead to other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products contribute to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
