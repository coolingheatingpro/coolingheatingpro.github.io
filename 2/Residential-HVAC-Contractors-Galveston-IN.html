Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during brand-new construction (homes generally use in between one and 5 lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>
