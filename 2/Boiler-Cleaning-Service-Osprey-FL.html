The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
