<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power should not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, since the total capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, considering that it takes into consideration not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem.

Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
