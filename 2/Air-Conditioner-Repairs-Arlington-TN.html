<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
