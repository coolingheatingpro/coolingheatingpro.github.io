<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
