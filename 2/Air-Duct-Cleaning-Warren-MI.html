<p>Though it might be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are lots of other contaminants that can not only filthy up the air, but lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products add to bad air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable organic compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality problem is developed merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complex problems-- identified by regularly undesirable air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending on the problem you're experiencing, one of the three tactics listed below might be proper.<p>
