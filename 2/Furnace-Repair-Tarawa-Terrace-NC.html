One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
