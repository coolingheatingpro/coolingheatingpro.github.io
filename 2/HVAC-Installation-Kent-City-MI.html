<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants given off by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity.

Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in most buildings.

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
