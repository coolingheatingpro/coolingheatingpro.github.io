<p>I am an investor, I require to change two heating systems in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as building materials, home furnishings and items like air fresheners, can release toxins basically constantly.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
