<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really thorough in discussing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn provided great customer support at the end of the appointment by explaining exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance jobs we might want to have actually performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and performance if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to search for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>

It's time to call a professional if at any point in the procedure of bleeding the furnace something appears weird or you lose self-confidence. Similarly, if the process doesn't work, something else is wrong and you need a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you need to do it often, it's most likely time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
