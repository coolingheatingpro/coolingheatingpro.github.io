<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is an extremely pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.
