<h3>The Way to Pick An HVAC Company at Huntertown IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
