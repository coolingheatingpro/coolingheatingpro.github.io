<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
