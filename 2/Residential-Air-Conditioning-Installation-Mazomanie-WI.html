<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight.
