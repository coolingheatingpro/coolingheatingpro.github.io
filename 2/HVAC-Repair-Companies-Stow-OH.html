Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality.

<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, given that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
