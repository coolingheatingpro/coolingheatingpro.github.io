<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
