In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Often a momentary indoor air quality problem is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location.
