This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may likewise include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to private areas.<p>

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
