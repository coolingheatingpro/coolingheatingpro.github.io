<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and cure-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
