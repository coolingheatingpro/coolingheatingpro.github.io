<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
