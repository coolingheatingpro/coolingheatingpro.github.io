<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes linked to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning system moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
