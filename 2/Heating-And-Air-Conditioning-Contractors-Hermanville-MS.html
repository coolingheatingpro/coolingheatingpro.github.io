<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
