<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
