<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
