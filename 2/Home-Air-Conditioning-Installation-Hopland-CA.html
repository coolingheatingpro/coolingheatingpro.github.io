<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
