<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
