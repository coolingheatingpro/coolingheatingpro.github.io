<h3>HVAC Service in Travis Afb CA</h3>

<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may notice moldy or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, speak to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
