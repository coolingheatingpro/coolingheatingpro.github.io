The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
