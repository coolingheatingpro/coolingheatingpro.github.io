Take some time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and secure.<p>

Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>

Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
