Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
