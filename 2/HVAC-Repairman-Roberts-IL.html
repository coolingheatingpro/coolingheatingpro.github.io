<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Immediate results may show up after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate effects are treatable and generally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is merely eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Signs of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise appear not long after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
