Unlike convection heating, convected heat systems have no air and no ductwork circulation. Radiant systems depend upon heat transfer by the infrared scientific principle utilized by the sun called line of sight." These unnoticeable electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a home, the warmer items naturally heat the cooler ones till a balance is attained.<p>

For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
