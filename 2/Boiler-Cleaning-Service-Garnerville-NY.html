<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may see unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.
