<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

Forced air heating unit also tend to produce cold and hot spots throughout your house, due to the nature of how warm air rises to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the technicians believed they just didn't seem ideal and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
