<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days might become a source for mold development and must be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in covert or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the location utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
