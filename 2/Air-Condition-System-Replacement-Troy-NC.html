Installing a new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a mild environment, where the temperature level does not get too low or too high. To put it simply, they are best for our Seattle environment! They are highly efficient, vanquishing most other types of heating systems in efficiency. The only genuine exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation usually costs tens of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which generally indicates it stops working in terms of return on investment.<p>
