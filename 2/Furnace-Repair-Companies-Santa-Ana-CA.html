<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry. Also, if the air conditioning system smells bad, there could be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your house.

<p>Whatever heating system you set up, it's essential that it's sized properly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize too much energy for the quantity of heat you want produced.
