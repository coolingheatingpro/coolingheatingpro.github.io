<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
