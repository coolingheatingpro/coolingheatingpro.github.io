<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Rocky Top TN Home</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
