<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
