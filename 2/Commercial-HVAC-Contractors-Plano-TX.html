As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires managed by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
