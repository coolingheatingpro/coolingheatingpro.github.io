<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires managed by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might select to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit if you do so.
