<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably typical, you can anticipate a minimum of one month during which temperature levels will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Just a few years ago, Seattle saw a record temperature level of 103 degrees, and there have been a lot of long, dry, hot streaks since then. A central air conditioning system in your home means you have the power to change the temperature level to a consistent temperature when the heat gets intolerable.<p>
