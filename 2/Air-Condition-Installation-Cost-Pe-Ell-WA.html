Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
