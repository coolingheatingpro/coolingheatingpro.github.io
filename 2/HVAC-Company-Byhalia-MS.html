Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>

<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally caused by the absence of adequate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the house.

Investigations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the exact same to be real. These examinations exposed that correct ventilation is important in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
