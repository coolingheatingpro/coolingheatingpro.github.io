<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>I am really pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
