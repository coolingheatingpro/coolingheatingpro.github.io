<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
