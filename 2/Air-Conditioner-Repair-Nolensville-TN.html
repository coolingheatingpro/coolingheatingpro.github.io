Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites need to find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a cruel, terrible summertime.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor system. Nevertheless, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and cooling styles, it may be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
