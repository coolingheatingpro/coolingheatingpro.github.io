<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide gas, radon, unstable organic substances ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce unfavorable health conditions. Source control, purification and using ventilation to dilute impurities are the main methods for enhancing indoor air quality in most structures. Residential systems can further enhance indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and rug.<p>
<p>Some health effects may show up quickly after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are typically short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins, symptoms of some illness such as asthma might show up, be intensified or gotten worse.<p>
<p>It is not advised that "routine" occupational direct exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to determine if the basic indoor air quality fulfills a particular requirement. Occupational direct exposure limits noted in health and wellness regulations and the Limit Limit Values ® (TLVs) suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to prevent illness or certain results (like eye and nose inflammation) in industrial situations. These limits might not be appropriate in workplace settings or for the house.<p>
