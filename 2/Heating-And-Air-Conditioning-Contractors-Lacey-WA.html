<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually caused by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of impurities from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the main problem in over half the office indoor air investigations it has conducted. Investigations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the very same to be real. These investigations revealed that proper ventilation is essential in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on numerous aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends upon specific sensitivity, which differs significantly from individual to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>If your single phase air conditioner isn't old adequate to justify replacement, consider an entire home dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can take pleasure in a few of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing greater convenience at higher temperatures.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
