<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
