<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
