<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
