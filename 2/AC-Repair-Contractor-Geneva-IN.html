<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to thaw your cooling equipment. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
