<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>As with most home enhancement projects, the cost of a complete central heater can vary extensively based on the size of the home. The majority of furnaces will last between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, property owners should consider heat output and effectiveness.

A small home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too rapidly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
