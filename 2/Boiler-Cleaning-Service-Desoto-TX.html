Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
