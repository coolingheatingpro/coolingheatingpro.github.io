<p>The predominant health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
