<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. Most house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Utilize or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common technique of minimizing exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will reduce however not get rid of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Because smoking cigarettes produces such large quantities of pollutants, natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not remove them from the air in your house as quickly as they build up. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it takes to substantially reduce exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs significantly. Consequently, the most efficient way to minimize direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of cigarette smoking there.<p>
