He got along, uncomplicated and a thoroughly enjoyable person to have around that whole time. His time and proficiency to RESOLVE the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a rather unsure diagnostic.<p>

<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Turn off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
