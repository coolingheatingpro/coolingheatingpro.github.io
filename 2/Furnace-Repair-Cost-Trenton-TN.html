<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
