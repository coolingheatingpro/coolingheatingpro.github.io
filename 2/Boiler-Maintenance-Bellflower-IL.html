<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
