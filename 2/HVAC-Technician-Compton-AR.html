<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
