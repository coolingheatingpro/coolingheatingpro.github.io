<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years back and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
