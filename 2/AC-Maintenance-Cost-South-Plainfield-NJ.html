<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic.
