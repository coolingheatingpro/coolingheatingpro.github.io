<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
