<p>Before you head out and buy an a/c, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioner be? Too large and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioning system and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioner won't have the ability to cool your house correctly.
