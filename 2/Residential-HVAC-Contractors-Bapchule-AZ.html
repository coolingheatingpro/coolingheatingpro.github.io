<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit.

That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
