<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was type of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
