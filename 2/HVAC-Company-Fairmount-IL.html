<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
