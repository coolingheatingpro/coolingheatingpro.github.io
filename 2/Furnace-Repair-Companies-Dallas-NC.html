The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for years, up until the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of the business continued under a number of owners. Goodrich's dad was a Goettl dealership in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity concerned purchase what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
