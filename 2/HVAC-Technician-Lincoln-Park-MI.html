<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Lincoln Park MI Home</h3>
<p>In the last numerous years, a growing body of scientific proof has suggested that the air within houses and other structures can be more seriously polluted than the outside air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research study indicates that people invest roughly 90 percent of their time inside. Therefore, for many individuals, the dangers to health might be higher due to exposure to air pollution inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
