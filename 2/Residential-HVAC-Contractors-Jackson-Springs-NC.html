<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
