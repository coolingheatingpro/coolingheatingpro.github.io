<p>The truth is, air pollution in your house can be simply as bad - and even worse - than it is outdoors. And with the typical American costs 87% of their life inside your home, you 'd think that indoor air quality would be something we 'd hear about more often. But do not panic!

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
