<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't provide agreements.  The so called reliable companies rip off more people than the fly by night attire.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
