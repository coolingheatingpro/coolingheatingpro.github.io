<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) describes less regular (but often more major) cases of people becoming ill after being in a particular building at a particular time. In these cases, there is typically a comparable set of scientific signs experienced by the individuals and a clear cause can typically be discovered upon examination. Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI brought on by germs which can infect a building's a/c system.<p>
<p>Air ducts are accountable for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your home, providing a comfortable environment in every room. However ducts that are not installed effectively or preserved can distribute impurities from one space to another. Over time, dust, dander and even mold can accumulate in your ducts, lowering the total air quality. Work with a professional to make sure your ducts are circulating fresh, tidy air.<p>

<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, saved fuels and paint products, and auto emissions in connected garages. Actions that will reduce benzene exposure consist of getting rid of smoking within the home, providing for maximum ventilation during painting, and disposing of paint materials and special fuels that will not be used instantly.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
