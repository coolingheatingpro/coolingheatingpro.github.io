<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
