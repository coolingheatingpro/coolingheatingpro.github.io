The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power needs to not surpass the capability of the outside unit.

Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not easy, given that it takes into consideration not only the small power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
