<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
