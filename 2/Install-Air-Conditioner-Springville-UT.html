<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
