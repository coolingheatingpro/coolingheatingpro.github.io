<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
