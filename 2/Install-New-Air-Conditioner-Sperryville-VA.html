If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, however there are many other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, but lead to other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products contribute to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery products can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a house heating unit, you may look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
