<p>Your questions or concerns about indoor air issues can often be responded to by the government agencies in your state or local government. Obligations for indoor air quality issues are usually divided among many different companies. Calling or composing the companies accountable for health or air quality control is the best method to begin getting details from your state or local government.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors.

Normal sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
