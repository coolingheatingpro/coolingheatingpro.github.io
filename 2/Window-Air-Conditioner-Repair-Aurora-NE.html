Let the unit cool off for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers.

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
