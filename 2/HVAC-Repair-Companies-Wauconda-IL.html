<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
