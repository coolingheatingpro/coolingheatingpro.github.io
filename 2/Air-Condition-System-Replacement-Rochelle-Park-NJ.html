<h3>Solar Heating System in Rochelle Park NJ</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
