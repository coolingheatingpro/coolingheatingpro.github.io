Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months.

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, because it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>Usually the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>For the majority of indoor air quality problems in the house, source control is the most reliable option. This section takes a source-by-source take a look at the most common indoor air toxins, their possible health impacts, and methods to minimize levels in the home.
