As a result your oil or natural gas furnace may run longer to offer the very same amount of heat. This will cause your energy costs to go up. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies each month could be used to assist you spend for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace.

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales guy concerns your home he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the options for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>
