<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like ac system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
