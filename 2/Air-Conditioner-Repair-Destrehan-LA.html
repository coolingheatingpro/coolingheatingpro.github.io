<p>A specific air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning system because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, given that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
