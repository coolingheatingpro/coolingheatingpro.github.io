<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no impurity sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions.
