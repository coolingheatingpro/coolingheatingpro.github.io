<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. If your a/c is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Just adding refrigerant is not an option if it leakages.

Remember that the efficiency and effectiveness of your a/c is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>

I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
