<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Saint Francis KY</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good possibility; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on rare events.<p>
