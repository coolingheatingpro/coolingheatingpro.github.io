<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and cure-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
