The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power must not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, given that the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level.

You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC unit is not draining pipes properly. A limitation in your drainage pipes causes a water leak. There are many different places a blockage can take place. One of the main areas where obstructions start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
