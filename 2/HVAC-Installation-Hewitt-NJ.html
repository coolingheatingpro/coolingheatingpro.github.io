<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Ensure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
